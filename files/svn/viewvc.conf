##
## Configuration file for ViewVC
##
## Information on ViewVC is located at the following web site:
##     http://viewvc.org/
##
##---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## THE FORMAT OF THIS CONFIGURATION FILE
##
##    This file is delineated by sections, specified in [brackets].  Within 
##    each section, are a number of configuration settings.  These settings
##    take the form of: name = value.  Values may be continued on the
##    following line by indenting the continued line.
##
##    WARNING:  Indentation *always* means continuation.  Name=value lines
##    should always start in column zero.
##
##    Comments should always start in column zero, and are identified
##    with "#".  By default each of the configuration items is
##    commented out, with the default value of the option shown.
##    You'll need to remove the '#' that precedes configuration
##    options whose values you wish to modify.
##
##    Certain configuration settings may have multiple values.  These should 
##    be separated by a comma.  The settings where this is allowed are noted 
##    below.  Any other setting that requires special syntax is noted at that
##    setting.
## 
##
## SOME TERMINOLOGY USED HEREIN
##
##    "root" - This is a CVS or Subversion repository.  For Subversion, the
##        meaning is pretty clear, as the virtual, versioned directory tree
##        stored inside a Subversion repository looks nothing like the actual
##        tree visible with shell utilities that holds the repository.  For
##        CVS, this is more confusing, because CVS's repository layout mimics
##        (actually, defines) the layout of the stuff housed in the repository.
##        But a CVS repository can be identified by the presence of a CVSROOT
##        subdirectory in its root directory.
##
##    "module" - A module is a top-level subdirectory of a root, usually
##        associated with the concept of a single "project" among many housed
##        within a single repository.
##
##
## BASIC VIEWVC CONFIGURATION HINTS
##
##    While ViewVC has quite a few configuration options, you generally
##    only need to change a small subset of them to get your ViewVC
##    installation working properly.  Here are some options that we
##    recommend you pay attention to.  Of course, don't try to change the
##    options here -- do so in the relevant section of the configuration
##    file below.
##    
##    For correct operation, you will probably need to change the following
##    configuration variables:
##   
##       cvs_roots (for CVS)
##       svn_roots (for Subversion)
##       root_parents (for CVS or Subversion)
##       default_root
##       root_as_url_component
##       rcs_dir
##       mime_types_files
##       the many options in the [utilities] section
##   
##    It is usually desirable to change the following variables:
##   
##       address
##       forbidden
##   
##    To optimize delivery of ViewVC static files:
##   
##       docroot
##   
##    To customize the display of ViewVC for your site:
##   
##       template_dir
##       the [templates] override section
##

##---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[general]

## cvs_roots: Specifies each of the CVS roots on your system and
## assigns names to them. Each root should be given by a "name: path"
## value. Multiple roots should be separated by commas and can be
## placed on separate lines.
##
## Example:
## cvs_roots = cvsroot: /opt/cvs/repos1,
##             anotherroot: /usr/local/cvs/repos2
##
#cvs_roots =

## svn_roots: Specifies each of the Subversion roots (repositories) on
## your system and assigns names to them. Each root should be given by
## a "name: path" value. Multiple roots should be separated by commas
## and can be placed on separate lines.
##
## Example:
## svn_roots = svnrepos: /opt/svn/,
##             anotherrepos: /usr/local/svn/repos2
##
#svn_roots =

## root_parents:  Specifies a list of directories in which any number of
## repositories may reside.  Rather than force you to add a new entry
## to 'cvs_roots' or 'svn_roots' each time you create a new repository,
## ViewVC rewards you for organising all your repositories under a few
## parent directories by allowing you to simply specifiy just those
## parent directories.  ViewVC will then notice each repository in that
## directory as a new root whose name is the subdirectory of the parent
## path in which that repository lives.
##
## You can specify multiple parent paths separated by commas or new lines.
##
## WARNING: these names can, of course, clash with names you have
## defined in your cvs_roots or svn_roots configuration items.  If this
## occurs, you can either rename the offending repository on disk, or
## grant new names to the clashing item in cvs_roots or svn_roots.
## Each parent path is processed sequentially, so repositories under
## later parent paths may override earlier ones.
##
## Example:
## root_parents = /opt/svn : svn,
##                /opt/cvs : cvs
##
#root_parents =
root_parents = /svnroot : svn

## default_root: This is the name of the default root.  Valid names
## include those explicitly listed in the cvs_roots and svn_roots
## configuration options, as well as those implicitly indicated by
## virtue of being the basenames of repositories found in the
## root_parents option locations.
##
## NOTE: This setting is ignored when root_as_url_component is enabled.
##
## Example:
## default_root = cvsroot
##
default_root = mediawiki

## mime_types_files: This is a list of pathnames to a set of MIME type
## mapping files to help ViewVC guess the correct MIME type of a
## versioned file.  The pathnames listed here are specified in order of
## authoritativeness either as absolute paths or relative to this
## configuration file.
##
## As a convenience, ViewVC provides a MIME type mapping file
## (mimetypes.conf) which is, by default, the preferred provider of
## MIME type mapping answers, but which is also empty.  If you find
## that ViewVC is unable to accurately guess MIME types based on the
## extensions of some of your versioned files, you can add records of
## your preferred mappings to the provided mimetypes.conf file (or to
## your system's mapping files, if you wish).
##
## You might, for example, wish to have ViewVC also consult the mapping
## files provided by your operating system and Apache.
##
## Example:
## mime_types_files = mimetypes.conf,
##                    /etc/mime.types,
##                    /usr/local/apache2/conf/mime.types
##
#mime_types_files = mimetypes.conf

## address: The address of the local repository maintainer.  (This
## option is provided only as a convenience for ViewVC installations
## which are using the default template set, where the value of this
## option will be displayed in the footer of every ViewVC page.)
##
## Example:
## address = admin@server.com
##
address = <a href="https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/"><img border="0" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Buggie.svg/38px-Buggie.svg.png" width="38" height="50">Bug the devs</a>

## kv_files: Provides a mechanism for custom key/value pairs to be
## available to templates.  These are stored in key/value (KV) files.
##
## The paths of the KV files are listed here, specified either as
## absolute paths or relative to this configuration file.  The files
## use the same format as this configuration file, containing one or
## more user-defined sections, and user-defined options in those
## sections.  ViewVC makes these options available to template authors
## as:
##
##    kv.SECTION.OPTION
##
## Note that an option name can be dotted.  For example:
##
##    [my_images]
##    logos.small = /images/small-logo.png
##    logos.big = /images/big-logo.png
##
## Templates can use these with a directive like:  [kv.my_images.logos.small]
##
## Note that section names which are common to multiple KV files will
## be merged.  If two files have a [my_images] section, then the
## options in those two like-named sections will be merged together.
## If two files have the same option name in a section, then one will
## overwrite the other (and which one "wins" is unspecified).
##
## To further categorize the KV files, and how the values are provided to
## the templates, a KV file name may be annotated with an additional level
## of dotted naming. For example:
##
##    kv_files = [asf]kv/images.conf
##
## Assuming the same section as above, the template would refer to an image
## using [kv.asf.my_images.logos.small]
##
## Lastly, it is possible to use %lang% in the filenames to specify a
## substitution of the selected language-tag.
##
## Example:
## kv_files = kv/file1.conf, kv/file2.conf, [i18n]kv/%lang%_data.conf
##
#kv_files =

## This option is a comma-separated list of language-tag values
## available to ViewVC.  The first language-tag listed is the default
## language, and will be used if an Accept-Language header is not
## present in the request, or none of the user's requested languages
## are available.  If there are ties on the selection of a language,
## then the first to appear in the list is chosen.
##
## Example:
## languages = en-us, en-gb, de
##
languages = en-us


##---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[utilities]

## ViewVC uses (sometimes optionally) various third-party programs to do some
## of the heavy lifting.  Generally, it will attempt to execute those utility
## programs in such a way that if they are found in ViewVC's executable
## search path ($PATH, %PATH%, etc.) all is well.  But sometimes these tools
## aren't installed in the executable search path, so here's where you can
## tell ViewVC where to find them.
##
## NOTE: Options with a "_dir" suffix are for configuring the
## directories in which certain programs live.  Note that this might
## not be the same directory into which the program's installer dumped
## the whole program package -- we want the deepest directory in which
## the executable program itself resides ("C:\rcstools\bin\win32"
## rather than just "C:\rcstools", for example).  The values of options
## whose names lack the "_dir" suffix should point to the actual
## program itself (such as "C:\Program Files\cvsnt\cvs.exe").


## rcs_dir: Directory in which the RCS utilities are installed, used
## for viewing CVS repositories.
##
## Example:
## rcs_dir = /usr/bin/
##
#rcs_dir =

## cvsnt: Location of cvsnt program.  ViewVC can use CVSNT (www.cvsnt.org)
## instead of the RCS utilities to retrieve information from CVS
## repositories.  To enable use of CVSNT, set the "cvsnt" value to the
## path of the CVSNT executable. (If CVSNT is on the standard path, you
## can also set it to the name of the CVSNT executable). By default
## "cvsnt" is set to "cvs" on Windows and is not set on other platforms.
##
## Examples:
## cvsnt = K:\Program Files\cvsnt\cvs.exe
## cvsnt = /usr/bin/cvs
## cvsnt = cvs
##
#cvsnt =

## svn: Location of the Subversion command-line client, used for
## viewing Subversion repositories.
##
## Example:
## svn = /usr/bin/svn
##
#svn =

## diff: Location of the GNU diff program, used for showing file
## version differences.
##
## Example:
## diff = /usr/bin/diff
##
#diff = 

## cvsgraph: Location of the CvsGraph program, a graphical CVS version
## graph generator (see options.use_cvsgraph).
##
## Example:
## cvsgraph = /usr/local/bin/cvsgraph
##
#cvsgraph =


##---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[options]

## root_as_url_component: Interpret the first path component in the URL
## after the script location as the root to use.  This is an
## alternative to using the "root=" query key. If ViewVC is configured
## with multiple repositories, this results in more natural looking
## ViewVC URLs.
##
## NOTE: Enabling this option will break backwards compatibility with
## any old ViewCVS URL which doesn't have an explicit "root" parameter.
##
root_as_url_component = 1

## checkout_magic: Use checkout links with magic /*checkout*/ prefixes so
## checked out HTML pages can have working links to other repository files
##
## NOTE: This option is DEPRECATED and should not be used in new ViewVC
## installations. Setting "default_file_view = co" achieves the same effect
##
checkout_magic = 0

## allowed_views: List the ViewVC views which are enabled.  Views not
## in this comma-delited list will not be served (or, will return an
## error on attempted access).
## Possible values: "annotate", "co", "diff", "markup", "roots", "tar"
##
allowed_views = annotate, co, diff, markup, roots

## authorizer: The name of the ViewVC authorizer plugin to use when
## authorizing access to repository contents.  This value must be the
## name of a Python module addressable as vcauth.MODULENAME (most
## easily accomplished by placing it in ViewVC's lib/vcauth/ directory)
## and which implements a ViewVCAuthorizer class (as a subclass of
## vcauth.GenericViewVCAuthorizer).  You can provide custom parameters
## to the authorizer module by defining configuration sections named
## authz-MODULENAME and adding the parameter keys and values there.
##
## ViewVC provides the following modules:
##   svnauthz    - based on Subversion authz files
##   forbidden   - simple path glob matches against top-level root directories
##   forbiddenre - root and path matches against regular expressions
##
## NOTE: Only one authorizer may be in use for a given ViewVC request.
## It doesn't matter if you configure the parameters of multiple
## authorizer plugins -- only the authorizer whose name is configured
## here (or effectively configured here via per-vhost or per-root
## configuration) will be activated.
##
authorizer = svnauthz

## hide_cvsroot: Don't show the CVSROOT directory
##   1      Hide CVSROOT directory
##   0      Show CVSROOT directory
##
## NOTE: Someday this option may be removed in favor of letting
## individual authorizer plugin hide the CVSROOT.
##
hide_cvsroot = 1

## mangle_email_addresses: Mangle email addresses in marked-up output.
## There are various levels of mangling available:
##   0 - No mangling; markup un-mangled email addresses as hyperlinks
##   1 - Obfuscation (using entity encoding); no hyperlinking
##   2 - Data-dropping address truncation; no hyperlinking
##
## NOTE: this will not effect the display of versioned file contents, only
## addresses that appear in version control metadata (e.g. log messages).
##
#mangle_email_addresses = 0

## default_file_view: "log", "co", or "markup"
## Controls whether the default view for file URLs is a checkout view or
## a log view. "log" is the default for backwards compatibility with old
## ViewCVS URLs, but "co" has the advantage that it allows ViewVC to serve
## static HTML pages directly from a repository with working links
## to other repository files
##
## NOTE: Changing this option may break compatibility with existing
## bookmarked URLs.
##
## ALSO NOTE: If you choose one of the "co" or "markup" views, be sure
## to enable it (via the allowed_views option)
##
#default_file_view = log

## http_expiration_time: Expiration time (in seconds) for cacheable
## pages served by ViewVC.  Note that in most cases, a cache aware
## client will only revalidate the page after it expires (using the
## If-Modified-Since and/or If-None-Match headers) and that browsers
## will also revalidate the page when the reload button is pressed.
## Set to 0 to disable the transmission of these caching headers.
##
http_expiration_time = 86400

## generate_etags: Generate Etag headers for relevant pages to assist
## in browser caching.
##   1      Generate Etags
##   0      Don't generate Etags
##
generate_etags = 1

## svn_ignore_mimetype: Don't consult the svn:mime-type property to
## determine how to display a file in the markup view.  This is
## especially helpful when versioned images carry the default
## Subversion-calculated MIME type of "application/octet-stream" (which
## isn't recognized as viewable type by browsers).
##
#svn_ignore_mimetype = 0

## svn_config_dir: Path of the Subversion runtime configuration
## directory ViewVC should consult for various things, including cached
## remote authentication credentials.  If unset, Subversion will use
## the default location(s) ($HOME/.subversion, etc.)
##
#svn_config_dir = 

## use_rcsparse: Use the rcsparse Python module to retrieve CVS
## repository information instead of invoking rcs utilities [EXPERIMENTAL]
##
use_rcsparse = 0

## sort_by: File sort order
##   file   Sort by filename
##   rev    Sort by revision number
##   date   Sort by commit date
##   author Sort by author
##   log    Sort by log message
##
sort_by = file

## sort_group_dirs: Group directories when sorting
##   1      Group directories together
##   0      No grouping -- sort directories as any other item would be sorted
##
sort_group_dirs = 1

## hide_attic: Hide or show the contents of the Attic subdirectory
##   1      Hide dead files inside Attic subdir
##   0      Show the files which are inside the Attic subdir
##
hide_attic = 1

## hide_errorful_entries: Hide or show errorful directory entries
## (perhaps due to not being readable, or some other rlog parsing
## error, etc.)
##   1      Hide errorful entries from the directory display
##   0      Show errorful entries (with their errors) in the directory display
##
#hide_errorful_entries = 0

## log_sort: Sort order for log messages
##   date   Sort revisions by date
##   rev    Sort revision by revision number
##   none   Use the version control system's ordering
##
log_sort = date

## diff_format: Default diff format
##   h      Human readable
##   u      Unified diff
##   c      Context diff
##   s      Side by side
##   l      Long human readable (more context)
##   f      Full human readable (entire file)
##
diff_format = h

## hr_breakable: Diff view line breaks
##   1     lines break at spaces
##   0     no line breaking
## Or, use a positive integer > 1 to cut lines after that many characters
##
hr_breakable = 1

## (Only works well for C source files, otherwise diff's heuristic falls short.)
## ('-p' option to diff)

hr_funout = 0

## hr_ignore_white: Ignore whitespace (indendation and stuff) for human
## readable diffs.
## ('-w' option to diff)
##
hr_ignore_white = 1

## hr_ignore_keyword_subst: Ignore diffs which are caused by keyword
## substitution (such as "$Id - Stuff").
## ('-kk' option to rcsdiff)
##
hr_ignore_keyword_subst = 1

## hr_intraline: Enable highlighting of intraline changes in human
## readable diffs.  [Requires Python 2.4]
##
hr_intraline = 0

## allow_compress: Allow compression via gzip of output if the Browser
## accepts it (HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING contains "gzip").
##
## NOTE: this relies on Python's gzip module, which has proven to be
## not-so-performant.  Enabling this feature should reduce the overall
## transfer size of ViewVC's responses to the client's request, but
## will do so with a speed penalty.
##
allow_compress = 0

## template_dir: The directory which contains the EZT templates used by
## ViewVC to customize the display of the various output views.  ViewVC
## looks in this directory for files with names that match the name of
## the view ("log", "directory", etc.) plus the ".ezt" extension.  If
## specified as a relative path, it is relative to the directory where
## this config file resides; absolute paths may be used as well.  If
## %lang% occurs in the pathname, then the selected language will be
## substituted.
## 
## SEE ALSO: the [templates] configuration section, where you can
## override templates on a per-view basis.
##
#template_dir = templates
template_dir = /etc/viewvc/templates

## docroot: Web path to a directory that contains ViewVC static files
## (stylesheets, images, etc.)  If set, static files will get
## downloaded directory from this location.  If unset, static files
## will be served by the ViewVC script (at a likely performance
## penalty, and from the "docroot" subdirectory of the directory
## specified by the "template_dir" option).
##
## NOTE: This option is evaluated outside the context of a particular
## root.  Be careful when using per-root configuration to select an
## alternate template set as the default value for this option will
## still be based on the global default template set per 'template_dir'
## above, not on 'template_dir' as overridden for a given root.
##
#docroot = 

## show_subdir_lastmod: Show last changelog message for CVS subdirectories
##
## NOTE: The current implementation makes many assumptions and may show
## the incorrect file at some times. The main assumption is that the
## last modified file has the newest filedate. But some CVS operations
## touches the file without even when a new version is not checked in,
## and TAG based browsing essentially puts this out of order, unless
## the last checkin was on the same tag as you are viewing.  Enable
## this if you like the feature, but don't rely on correct results.
##
## SECURITY WARNING: Enabling this will currently leak unauthorized
## path names.

## use_re_search: Enable regular expression search of files in a directory.
##
## WARNING: Enabling this option can consume HUGE amounts of server
## time. A "checkout" must be performed on *each* file in a directory,
## and the result needs to be searched for a match against the regular
## expression.
##
## SECURITY WARNING: Since a user can enter the regular expression, it
## is possible for them to enter an expression with many alternatives
## and a lot of backtracking. Executing that search over thousands of
## lines over dozens of files can easily tie up a server for a long
## period of time.  This option should only be used on sites with
## trusted users. It is highly inadvisable to use this on a public site.
##
use_re_search = 0

## dir_pagesize: Maximum number of directory entries on a given page.
## This allows ViewVC to present discrete pages to the users instead of
## the entire directory.  Set to 0 to disable pagination.

## log_pagesize: Maximum number of revision log entries on a given page.
## This allows ViewVC to present discrete pages to the users instead of
## the entire revision log.  Set to 0 to disable pagination.
##
log_pagesize = 50

## limit_changes: Maximum number of changed paths shown per commit in
## the Subversion revision view and in query results. This is not a
## hard limit (the UI provides options to show all changed paths), but
## it prevents ViewVC from generating enormous and hard to read pages
## by default when they happen to contain import or merge commits
## affecting hundreds or thousands of files.  Set to 0 to disable the
## limit.
##
limit_changes = 100

##---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[templates]

## You can override the templates used by various ViewVC views in this
## section.  By default, ViewVC will look for templates in the
## directory specified by the "template_dir" configuration option (see
## the documentation for that option for details).  But if you want to
## use a different template for a particular view, simply uncomment the
## appropriate option below and specify the currect location of the EZT
## template file you wish to use for that view.
## 
## Templates are specified relative to the configured template
## directory (see the "template_dir" option), but absolute paths may
## also be used as well.
##
## If %lang% occurs in the pathname, then the selected language will be
## substituted.
##
## NOTE: the selected language is defined by the "languages" item in the
##       [general] section, and based on the request's Accept-Language
##       header.

[vhosts]

## Virtual hosts are individual logical servers accessible via
## different hostnames, but which are all really the same physical
## computer.  For example, you might have your web server configured to
## accept incoming traffic for both http://www.yourdomain.com/ and
## http://viewvc.yourdomain.com/.  Users pointing their web browsers at
## each of those two URLs might see entirely different content via one
## URL versus the other, but all that content actually lives on the
## same computer, is served up via the same web server, and so
## on.  It just *looks* like its coming from multiple servers.
##
## ViewVC allows you to customize its configuration options for
## individual virtual hosts.  You might, for example, wish to expose
## all of your Subversion repositories at http://svn.yourdomain.com/viewvc/ 
## and all your CVS ones at http://cvs.yourdomain.com/viewvc/, with no
## cross-exposure.  Using ViewVC's virtual host (vhost) configuration
## support, you can do this.  Simply create two vhost configurations
## (one for each of your hostnames), then configure the cvs_roots
## option only for the vhost associated with cvs.yourdomain.com, and
## configure the svn_roots option only for the vhost associated with
## svn.yourdomain.com.
##
## This section is a freeform configuration section, where you create
## both the option names and their values.  The names of the options
## are then treated as canonical names of virtual hosts, and their
## values are defined to be comma-delimited lists of hostname globs
## against which incoming ViewVC requests will be matched to figure out
## which vhost they apply to.
##
## After you've named and defined your vhosts, you may then create new
## configuration sections whose names are of the form
## vhost-VHOSTNAME/CONFIGSECTION.  VHOSTNAME here is the canonical name
## of one of the virtual hosts you defined under the [vhosts] section.
## Inside those configuration sections, you override the standard
## ViewVC options typically found in the base configuration section
## named CONFIGSECTION ("general", "option", etc.)
##
## NOTE: Per-vhost overrides may only be applied to the following
## sections:
##
##    general
##    options
##    utilities
##    templates
##    cvsdb
##    authz-*
##
## Here is an example:
##
## [vhosts]
## libs = libs.yourdomain.*, *.yourlibs.*
## gui = guiproject.yourdomain.*
##
## [vhost-libs/general]
## cvs_roots = 
## svn_roots = svnroot: /var/svn/libs-repos
## default_root = svnroot
##
## [vhost-libs/options]
## show_logs = 1
##
## [vhost-gui/general]
## cvs_roots = cvsroot: /var/cvs/guiproject
## svn_roots = 
## default_root = cvsroot
##

##---------------------------------------------------------------------------
## ViewVC recognizes per-root configuration overrides, too.  To
## override the value of a configuration parameter only for a single
## root, create a configuration section whose names is of the form
## root-ROOTNAME/CONFIGSECTION.  ROOTNAME here is the name of the root
## as defined explicitly in cvs_roots or svn_roots or implicitly as the
## basename of a root path in root_parents.  Options found in this new
## configuration section override for this one root the corresponding
## options found in the base configuration section CONFIGSECTION
## ("options", "authz-*", etc.) as interpreted after per-vhost
## overrides (if any) have been applied.
##
## NOTE: Per-root overrides may only be applied to the following
## sections:
##
##    options
##    utilities
##    authz-*
##
## WARNING: Do not use per-root overrides if your ViewVC instance is
## served via the standalone.py server option!  Doing so could cause
## ViewVC to be unable to function properly (or at all).
##
## Here is an example showing how to enable Subversion authz-based
## authorization for only the single root named "svnroot":
## 
## [root-svnroot/options]
## authorizer = svnauthz
##
## [root-svnroot/authz-svnauthz]
## authzfile = /path/to/authzfile
##

##---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[authz-forbidden]

## The "forbidden" authorizer forbids access to repository modules,
## defined to be top-level subdirectories in a repository.
##
## NOTE: The options in this section apply only when the 'authorizer'
## option (in the [options] section) is set to 'forbidden'.

## forbidden: A comma-delimited list of patterns which match modules
## that ViewVC should hide from users.
##
## You can use a simple list of modules, or something more complex:
##
##   *) The "!" can be used before a module to explicitly state that it
##      is NOT forbidden. Whenever this form is seen, then all modules will
##      be forbidden unless one of the "!" modules match.
##
##   *) Shell-style "glob" expressions may be used. "*" will match any
##      sequence of zero or more characters, "?" will match any single
##      character, "[seq]" will match any character in seq, and "[!seq]"
##      will match any character not in seq.
##
##   *) Tests are performed in sequence. The first match will terminate the
##      testing. This allows for more complex allow/deny patterns.
##
## Tests are case-sensitive.
##
## NOTE: Again, this is for the hiding of modules within repositories, *not* 
## for the hiding of repositories (roots) themselves.
##
## Some examples:
##
##    Disallow "example" but allow all others:
##       forbidden = example
##
##    Disallow "example1" and "example2" but allow all others:
##       forbidden = example1, example2
##
##    Allow *only* "example1" and "example2":
##       forbidden = !example1, !example2
##
##    Forbid modules starting with "x":
##       forbidden = x*
##
##    Allow modules starting with "x" but no others:
##       forbidden = !x*
##
##    Allow "xml", forbid other modules starting with "x", and allow the rest:
##       forbidden = !xml, x*, !*
##
#forbidden = 

##---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[authz-forbiddenre]

## The "forbiddenre" authorizer forbids access to repositories and
## repository paths by comparing a list of regular expressions
## (separated by commas) against paths consisting of the repository (or
## root) name plus the path of the versioned file or directory to be
## tested.  For example, to see if the user is authorized to see the
## path "/trunk/www/index.html" in the repository whose root name is
## "svnrepos", this authorizer will check the path
## "svnrepos/trunk/www/index.html" against the list of forbidden
## regular expressions.  Directory paths will be terminated by a forward
## slash.
##
## NOTE: The options in this section apply only when the 'authorizer'
## option (in the [options] section) is set to 'forbiddenre'.

## forbiddenre: A comma-delimited list of regular expressions which
## match paths that ViewVC should hide from users.
##
## Like the "forbidden" authorizer...
##
##   *) The "!" can be used before a module to explicitly state that it
##      is NOT forbidden. Whenever this form is seen, then all modules will
##      be forbidden unless one of the "!" modules match.
##
##   *) Tests are performed in sequence. The first match will terminate the
##      testing. This allows for more complex allow/deny patterns.
##
## Unlike the "forbidden" authorizer, you can can use this to hide roots, too.
##
## Some examples:
##
##    Disallow files named "PRIVATE", but allow all others:
##       forbiddenre = /PRIVATE$
##
##    Disallow the "hidden" repository, allowing all others:
##       forbiddenre = ^hidden(/|$)
##
##    Allow only the "example1" and "example2" roots and the paths inside them,
##    disallowing all others (which can be done in multiple ways):
##       forbiddenre = !^example1(/|$), !^example2(/|$)/
##       forbiddenre = !^example[12](/|$)
##
##    Only allow visibility of HTML files and the directories that hold them:
##       forbiddenre = !^([^/]+|.*(/|\.html))$
##
#forbiddenre = 

##---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[authz-svnauthz]

## The "svnauthz" authorizer uses a Subversion authz configuration file
## to determine access to repository paths.
##
## NOTE: The options in this section apply only when the 'authorizer'
## option (in the [options] section) is set to 'svnauthz'.

## authzfile: Specifies the location of the authorization rules file
## (using an absolute path).
##
authzfile = /etc/apache2/svn-authz

## force_username_case: Like the AuthzForceUsernameCase httpd.conf
## directive, set this to "upper" or "lower" to force the normalization
## to upper- or lower-case, respectively, of incoming usernames prior
## to comparison against the authorization rules files.  Leave the
## option unset to preserve the username case.
##
#force_username_case =
