##  This script's goal is to call swiftcleaner with all the objects added to Swift
##  since the last run.  Specifically, this script collects the list of containers
##  and an object listing of each container.  It keeps these in a cache directory.
##  It finds the differences from the previous run then calls swiftcleaner with
##  that listing.
