# Copy2 is hairy. If we were only opening a URL, and returning it, we could
# just return the open file handle, and webob would take care of reading from
# the socket and returning the data to the client machine. If we were only
# opening a URL and writing its contents out to Swift, we could call
# put_object with the file handle and it would take care of reading from
# the socket and writing the data to the Swift proxy.
#     We have to do both at the same time. This requires that we hand over a class which
# is an iterable which reads, writes one copy to Swift (using put_object_chunked), and
# returns a copy to webob.  This is controlled by writethumb in /etc/swift/proxy.conf,
