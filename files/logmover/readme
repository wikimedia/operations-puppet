puppet/manifests/logmover/ is a directory containing stuff that's used for
fundraising impression/banner/landingpage log collection and archiving

See http://wikitech.wikimedia.org/view/Fundraising_Analytics/Impression_Stats
for an overview of how these work together.

Currently there are two files checked in here. They are *not* puppetized mostly
because jgreen hasn't yet figured out way to puppetize them that doesn't seem
comparably hacky to installing them by hand.

gzip_incoming_logs.pl - installed by hand
storage3:/home/logmover/scripts/gzip_incoming_logs.pl and run by logmover's
cron

rotate_logs_and_copy_to_storage3.pl - installed by hand at
locke:/home/file_mover/scripts/rotate_logs_and_copy_to_storage3.pl and run by
file_mover's cron.
