# this is a default Debian/Ubuntu ports.conf _besides_ NameVirtualHost *:80 being commented
# it avoids "NameVirtualHost *:80 has no VirtualHosts"-warnings because of a duplicate definition when using "apache_confd { namevirtualhost.." with puppet

# If you just change the port or add more ports here, you will likely also
# have to change the VirtualHost statement in
# /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default
# This is also true if you have upgraded from before 2.2.9-3 (i.e. from
# Debian etch). See /usr/share/doc/apache2.2-common/NEWS.Debian.gz and
# README.Debian.gz
