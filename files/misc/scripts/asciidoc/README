On Mac OS X with homebrew:

 $ brew install asciidoc

Should also install docbook

IMPORTANT Edit your ~/.bashrc to add:
export XML_CATALOG_FILES="/usr/local/etc/xml/catalog"

 $ a2x --doctype manpage --format manpage

You can pass --verbose to get more details about what is being done.


FAQ

If you get an error like:
a2x: ERROR: "xmllint" --nonet --noout --valid "/Users/amusso/projects/operations/puppet/files/misc/scripts/asciidoc/_annotated.1.xml" returned non-zero exit status 4

That is most probably because `xmllint` is unable to find the docbook catalog. You can use XML_CATALOG_FILES to add a XML catalog.
