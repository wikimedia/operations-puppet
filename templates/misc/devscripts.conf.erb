# This file is managed by Puppet!

# This configuration file gives defaults for the scripts in
# the devscripts package, as documented in the individual manpages.
# Variables defined here may be overridden by a per-user ~/.devscripts
# configuration file, which has exactly the same syntax as this file.
# 
# This file is sourced by /bin/bash, and should only contain
# comment lines (beginning with a '#'), and lines of the form
# VARIABLE=value
# The value must be quoted if there are spaces in it.
# Variables corresponding to switches (on/off; yes/no) must take
# one of the values 'yes' or 'no'.
# The variable names are all of the form PROGNAME_VARNAME,
# or DEVSCRIPTS_VARNAME if they are more generally applicable.
# 
# As new variables are introduced into the devscripts program, their
# descriptions and default values will be appended as comments
# to this file.

# Variables recognised as of devscripts version 2.10.61ubuntu5:

##### Package-wide variables
# 
# Lists of which scripts are affected by these package-wide variables
# can be found in the devscripts.conf(5) manpage.
# 
# 
# Directory Name Checking
# 
# Several programs check the directory name and refuse to function if
# it does not match the name of the package being worked on.  (The
# details are described in the individual manpages.)
# These two variables control this behaviour, corresponding to the
# --check-dirname-level and --check-dirname-regex command line options.
# The possible values of DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL are:
#   0    never check the directory name
#   1    check the directory name only if the program has changed directory
#   2    always check the directory name
# The variable DEVSCRIPTS_DIRNAME_REGEXP is a Perl regex which
# defines what is considered a valid directory name for the source
# package PACKAGE; if it includes a '/', then it must match the full
# directory path, otherwise it must match the full directory name.
# 
# The default settings are:
# DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL=1
# DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX='PACKAGE(-.+)?'
