/*****************************************************************************
 * Varnish VCL include file for WMF-Last-Access Cookie
 * Please see what this cookie is trying to acomplish:
 * https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/Unique_clients/Last_visit_solution
 *
 * General notes on timestamp format strings used here:
 * "now" stringifies as "Wed, 01 Jan 2000 01:01:01 GMT", which is the same
 * format used by Set-Cookie "Expires" data.  The format for the last access
 * value, and thus X-NowDay and X-WMF-LastStamp as well, is "01-Jan-2000"
 * (because the other info is redundant or too-specific, and cookie values
 * shouldn't have whitespace or commas).
 ****************************************************************************/

/*****************************************************************************
 * This must be called *before* any vcl_recv cookie munging.  It more-properly
 * belongs in _deliver, but putting it here avoids all of the issues
 * surrounding consistent access to Cookie vs X-Orig-Cookie at vcl_deliver
 * time in the text/mobile cases.
 * It does so at the cost of sending a pointless and unintended
 * "X-WMF-LastStamp: 01-Jan-2000" header to the application layer as well on
 * cache miss/bypass.
 * Note we don't validate that the cookie's 3-letter month abbreviation is
 * legal, or that the numeric values for the date/year are legal, just that
 * they have the right count of the right kinds of characters.
