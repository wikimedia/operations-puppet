	// By letting Authorization reqs cache, we're breaking our own OAuth
	// in some corner cases: https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T105387

	// cause a redirect to be cached, which then affects real fetches that
	// have the Authorization header set, which is Bad.

	// requests in general, but on the other hand, I see a lot of random
	// Authorization headers in our traffic that don't look like stuff
	// we're using or want to pay attention to, and we've otherwise seemed
	// ok on this stuff.  So for now, only (pass) on ones that seem to
	// have OAuth data, with the same header-matching as in:
