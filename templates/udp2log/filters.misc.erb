pipe 10 /usr/bin/packet-loss 10 '\t' >> <%= log_directory %>/packet-loss.log

### This feeds all http related graphs in graphite / gdash.wikimedia.org
# We moved this to erbium on Jan 30, and recently have been noticing
# erratic graphs.  Moving sqstat to this misc udp2log instance to
# see if erratic graphs were caused by lossy multicast or just by
# general business on erbium.
