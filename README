The Wikimedia Foundation operates some of the largest collaboratively edited
reference projects in the world, including Wikipedia. Our infrastructure powers
some of the most highly-trafficked sites on the web, serving content in over a
hundred languages to more than half a billion people each month. We use Puppet
to manage our server configuration. This is our Puppet repository.

For an overview of how we use Puppet, and a review of the code conventions and
patterns that apply to this repository, see:

The code in this repository is authored and maintained by Wikimedia engineers
and a vibrant community of volunteer contributors. Get involved!
