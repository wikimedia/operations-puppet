  # This is a readonly version of the private repo.  readonly is enforced by various pre-* hooks.
  # This repo is linked into the /etc/puppet and is the repo that the puppet servers actully read.
  # Updates to this repo are handled by a post-reiceve hook in the above private repo which forces
  # this repo to perform a pull.
  # The main reason for this duplication is to ensure puppet only acts on files that have been committed.
  # i.e. if we simply used the above repo it would be possible for puppet to act on files that where still
  # being edited, not committed and potentially broken
