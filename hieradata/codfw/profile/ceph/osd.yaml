# OSD nodes have their own storage vlan; these hosts
#  will have arbitrary cluster addresses in 192.168.4.0/22
#
# The 'public' address here does not refer to the WMF public vlan,
#  but rather the ceph 'public' address which is used by clients
#  (in the near-term, hypervisors) to access storage.  Do not be
#  alarmed that the public addresses are on private IPs.
#
# Please be aware the last 3 IPs on the first /24 in the storage
# subnet are reserved for network equipment (top-of-rack switches)
# so please do not assign to end hosts:
#
# 192.168.4.252
# 192.168.4.253
# 192.168.4.254
