# we name the container docker_registry_codfw in eqiad due to the way dinamic large objects and docker-distribution works
# dymanic large objects in swift: https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/overview_large_objects.html
# TL;DR a manifest file is uploaded including the container_name/file and list of segments.
# codfw was the "active" DC, so each image uploaded there has a manifest file that includes 'docker_registry_codfw'
# container synchronization worked and replicated the segments files and the manifest as is, obviously swift
# would not use a manifest that refers to 'docker_registry_codfw' on 'docker_registry_eqiad'
# this problem is stated on the Note block in Swift container synchronization docs https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/overview_container_sync.html
