# The contents of this hash control our DC->DC routing for varnish backend
# daemons.  There should be a key for every cache datacenter.  The values must
# be a core datacenter (eqiad or codfw), or at least must lead indirectly to
# a core datacenter when traversing the table recursively.  A loop between
# the two core datacenters is expected and normal here.  The only reason to
# edit this is to remove a datacenter from active service (due to fault or
# maintenance) by routing around it from the edge sites.
