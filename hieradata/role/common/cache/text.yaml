# The contents of this hash control our DC->DC routing for varnish backend
# daemons.  There should be a key for every cache datacenter, and the
# values can be another datacenter or 'direct', which means contact the
# applayer directly.
#
# Currently, the possible datacenter-name values for non-direct are limited
# to 'eqiad', and 'codfw' because they're the only ones defined in
# 'backend_caches' in role::cache::instances.
#
# Note that it is possible to create permanent or temporary-race-condition
# loops by making poor changes to this hash!  Keeping in mind that the
# state here will be applied to cache daemons asynchronously, the general
# rules of safety would be:
# 1. Obviously, a commit should not create actual loops which do not
#    eventually resolve to 'direct'
# 2. A single commit->deploy should only change one single value at a time
#    unless you're absolutely certain of what you're doing, as changing
#    multiple values could cause a race-condition of intermediate states.
