# which works out to 49 for our servers. When search is stalled on IO it makes sense
# to have more threads than cores, but we never see our servers stalled out on IO.
# We have seen (T169498) servers completely exhaust their CPU though, so setting
# this to match cpu counts to prevent overcommit of CPU resources.
