# ca-manager will use a self signed CA cert to authenticate clients.
# Some clients (e.g. MirrorMaker) will need to talk to multiple Kafka
# clusters.  So, we need all production Kafka clusters to use the same root CA, which
# means that ca-manager must have all clusters that might need to authenticate
# a client to be configured in the same ca-manager manifest config file.
# All certs will be in a single ca-manager base directory.  This should
# match what is in the operations puppet private repository in the secrets module.
