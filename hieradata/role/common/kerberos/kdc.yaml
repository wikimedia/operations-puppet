# In T257412 the Analytics team came up with a new setting
# for dns_canonicalize_hostname=false to allow daemons/services
# (like hive) to have principals like:
# hive/analytics-hive.eqiad.wmnet@WIKIMEDIA
# as opposed to the more canonical ones like:
# hive/an-coord1003.eqiad.wmnet@WIKIMEDIA
# The goal is to have services that can share a principal,
# and use DNS CNAMEs (like analytics-hive.eqiad.wmnet) to
# achieve better availability/failover.
# The only thing that complained for the new setting is
# kprop, emitting the following error when trying to replicate
# the krb database (to the other end where kpropd was listening):
# /usr/sbin/kprop: Key table entry not found while getting initial credentials
# Don't add back dns_canonicalize_hostname=false!
# TODO: Revisit this when upgrading to Debian 11.
