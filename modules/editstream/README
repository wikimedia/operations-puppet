EditStream
----------

This module contains a simple and self-contained software stack for streaming
recent changes from a MediaWiki instance. It subscribe to the 'edits' topic of
a Redis server and forwards incoming messages to web clients using socket.io,
a convenience layer over the WebSockets protocol. Each server instance is
implemented in Python and uses gevent to support serving multiple clients
concurrently. Nginx serves as a load-balancer and reverse proxy.

To use this module, you must first configure MediaWiki to publish recent
changes to a Redis instance:

    $wgRCFeeds['redis'] = array(
         'formatter' => 'JSONRCFeedFormatter',
         'uri'       => 'redis://127.0.0.1:6379/edits',
    );

The following example shows how to configure Nginx to reverse-proxy three
EditStream server instances, running locally on ports 10080-10082:

    $backends = [ 10080, 10081, 10082 ]

    class { '::editstream':
      iface => '127.0.0.1',
      ports => $backends,
    }

    class { '::editstream::proxy':
      backends => $backends,
    }


To utilize the edit stream in the context of a web application, you will need
to load socket.io's JavaScript library and subscribe to the stream. For example:

  <html>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <script src="static/socket.io.js"></script>
    <script>
      var socket = io.connect( 'live.wikimedia.org/edits' );
      socket.on( 'edit', function ( data ) {
         console.log( data );
      } );
    </script>
  </html>

socket.io may be obtained from <http://socket.io/>.

TODOs:
* SSL / wss support (see <http://siriux.net/2013/06/nginx-and-websockets/>).
* Configure Nginx to serve static assets.
