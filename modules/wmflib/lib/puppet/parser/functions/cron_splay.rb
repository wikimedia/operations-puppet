  newfunction(:cron_splay, :type => :rvalue, :doc => <<-EOS
Given an array of fqdn which a cron is applicable to, and a period arg which is
one of 'hourly', 'daily', or 'weekly', this sorts the fqdn set with
per-datacenter interleaving for DC-numbered hosts, splays them to fixed even
intervals within the total period, and then outputs a set of crontab time
fields for the fqdn currently being compiled-for.

The idea here is to ensure each host in the set executes the cron once per time
period, and also ensure the time between hosts is consistent (no edge cases
much closer than the average) by splaying them as evenly as possible with
rounding errors.  For the case of hosts with NNNN numbers indicating the
datacenter in the first digit, we also maximize the period between any two
hosts in a given datacenter by interleaving sorted per-DC lists of hosts before
splaying.

The third and final argument is a static seed which modulates the splayed
values in two different ways to minimize the effects of multiple cron_splay()
with the same hostlist and period.  It is used to select a determinstically
random "offset" for the splayed time values (so that the first host doesn't
always start at 00:00), and is also used to permute the order of the hosts
within each DC uniquely.

*Examples:*

    $times = fqdn_splay($hosts, 'weekly', 'foo-static-seed')
    cron { 'foo':
        minute   => $times['minute'],
        hour     => $times['hour'],
        weekday  => $times['weekday'],
    }
