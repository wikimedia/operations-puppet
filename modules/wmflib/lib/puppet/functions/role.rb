# == Function: role ( string $role_name [, string $... ] )
#
# Declare the _roles variable (or add keys to it), and if the role class
# role::$role_name is in the scope, include it. This is roughly a
# shortcut for
#
# $::_roles[foo] = true
# include role::foo
#
# and has the notable advantage over that the syntax is shorter. Also,
# this function  will refuse to run anywhere but at the node scope,
# thus making any additional role added to a node explicit.
#
# If you have more than one role to declare, you MUST do that in one
# single role stanza, or you would encounter unexpected behaviour. If
# you do, an exception will be raised.
#
# This function is very useful with our "role" hiera backend if you
# have global configs that are role-based
#
# === Example
#
# node /^www\d+/ {
#     role mediawiki::appserver  # this will load the role::mediawiki::appserver class
#     include ::standard  #this class will use hiera lookups defined for the role.
# }
#
# node monitoring.local {
#     role icinga, ganglia::collector #GOOD
# }
#
# node monitoring2.local {
#     role icinga
#     role ganglia::collector #BAD, issues a warning
# }
