# Role-based Hiera backend

#
#
# This backend allows to group definitions based on the roles defined
# at the node level using the 'role' keyword.
# It allows searching in hierarchies that are based on the role
# currently applied; this is very handy if you have group of hosts
# whose configuration is dependent on their role rather than on other
# facts like hostnames.
#
# == How this works
#
# Whenever you use the 'role' keyword in a node:
#
#   role cache::text
#
# Two things happen:
# - the class role::cache::text gets included in the current node
# - this gets registered in a global registry
#
# Whenever a hiera lookup is performed and the role backend is used,
# the key is searched in all the hierarchies defined in the
# :role_hierarchy.
#
# A typical hierarchy would be:
# - "%{::environment}"
# - common
#
# The path in which the files must be is as follows:
# role/${hierarchy}/<path>.yaml
# where <path> corresponds to the argument passed to the 'role'
# keyword.
#
# === Example
#
# In site.pp:
#
# node /pinkunicorn.wikimedia.org/ {
#      role foo::bar, fizzbuzz
#      notice(hiera('admin::groups'))
# }
#
# Give the hierarchy from before, the final hiera lookup will result
# in searching admin::groups in two distinct hierarchies:
#
# role/production/foo/bar.yaml
# role/common/foo/bar.yaml
#
# role/production/fizzbuzz.yaml
# role/common/fizzbuzz.yaml
#
# The research will be performed for *both* hierarchies as a normal
# hiera lookup; if a plain lookup is performed, the results of the two
# searches will be compared; if they differ, an exception will be
# thrown, so that conflicting directives will need manual resolution.
#
# === Things to pay attention to
#
# One big caveat: if you do use multiple times the role keyword, any
# class included by the first role keyword is declared  would be
# evaluated just after the first "role" has been called, thus
# not having the full scope of both to search from; this could result
# in unexpected behaviour so I advice _against_ using multiple role
# keywords in a single node, if both roles include conflicting
# classes.
