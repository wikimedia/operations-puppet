commands=$(ls /usr/bin/kafka-* | xargs -n 1 basename | sed 's@kafka-@  @g')

USAGE="
$SCRIPT_NAME <command> [options]

Handy wrapper around various kafka-* scripts.  Set the environment variables
KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_URL, KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS so you don't have to keep typing
--zookeeper-connect, --broker-list or --bootstrap-server each time you want to
use a kafka-* script.

Usage:

Run $SCRIPT_NAME <command> with zero arguments/options to see command usage.

Commands:
$commands

Environment Variables:
  KAFKA_JAVA_HOME         - Value of JAVA_HOME to use for invoking Kafka commands.
  KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_URL     - If this is set, any commands that take a --zookeeper
                            flag will be given this value.
  KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS - If this is set, any commands that take a --broker-list or
                            --bootstrap-server flag will be given this value.
                            Also any command that take a --authorized-property
                            will get the correct zookeeper.connect value.

# Until https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-4307 is available, there are
