USAGE="
$SCRIPT_NAME <command> [options]

Handy wrapper around various kafka-* scripts.  Set the environment variables
ZOOKEEPER_URL and BROKER_LIST so you don't have to keep typing
--zookeeper-connect or --broker-list each time you want to use a kafka-*
script.

Usage:

Run $SCRIPT_NAME <command> with zero arguments/options to see command usage.

Commands:
$commands

Environment Variables:
  ZOOKEEPER_URL - If this is set, any commands that take a --zookeeper flag will be given this value.
  BROKER_LIST   - If this is set, any commands that take a --broker-list flag will be given this value.
