# backy configuration for backy2 Version 2

[DEFAULTS]
# Where should the backy logfile be placed?
# Backy will by default log INFO, WARNING and ERROR to this log.
# If you also need DEBUG information, please start backy with '-v'.
logfile: /var/log/backy.log

# Default block size. 4MB are recommended.
# DO NOT CHANGE WHEN BACKUPS EXIST!
block_size: 4194304

# Hash function to use. Use a large one to avoid collisions.
# DO NOT CHANGE WHEN BACKUPS EXIST!
hash_function: sha512

# for some operations, full backy or single versions need to be locked for
# simulatanous access. In the lock_dir we will create backy_*.lock files.
lock_dir: /run

# Directory where temporary data is stored when changing data in fuse mounts
cachedir: /tmp

# To be able to find other backys running, we need a system-wide unique name
# for all backy processes.
# DO NOT CHANGE WHILE backy2 PROCESSES ARE RUNNING!
process_name: backy2

# Allow rm of backup versions after n days (set to 0 to disable, i.e. to be
# able to delete any version)
disallow_rm_when_younger_than_days: 3

# Use deduplication? This will create some load on your database
# but we will find same blocks and won't store them twice.
deduplication: 1

# All backy2 data is encrypted in the data backends. Generate a key via
# $ openssl rand -hex 32
# The key must be in hex notation (which the above command will output).
# Here is an example. Create your own and make sure you save it elsewhere. If
# this key is lost, all your backups are too.
# If unset, no encryption will be used.
# encryption_key: none

# Encryption versions:
# 0: No encryption/compression
# 1: AES_GCM 256 bit encryption + zstandard level 1 compression
# NOTE:
# If you install this on ubuntu 18.04 (or less) you cannot use the system's
# packages for zstandard (non existant) or pycryptodome (too old).
# You will have to manually
#   $ sudo pip3 install zstandard
#   $ sudo pip3 install pycryptodome
# Until ubuntu has newer packages, we will stick with default
# encryption_version 0 for better user experience.
encryption_version: 0
