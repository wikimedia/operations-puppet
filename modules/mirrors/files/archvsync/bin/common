# Little common functions

# push a mirror attached to us.
# Arguments (using an array named SIGNAL_OPTS):
#
# $MIRROR      - Name for the mirror, also basename for the logfile
# $HOSTNAME    - Hostname to push to
# $USERNAME    - Username there
# $SSHPROTO    - Protocol version, either 1 or 2.
# $SSHKEY      - the ssh private key file to use for this push
# $SSHOPTS     - any other option ssh accepts, passed blindly, be careful
# $PUSHLOCKOWN - own lockfile name to touch after stage1 in pushtype=staged
# $PUSHTYPE    - what kind of push should be done?
#                all    - normal, just push once with ssh backgrounded and finish
#                staged - staged. first push stage1, then wait for $PUSHLOCKs to appear,
#                         then push stage2
# $PUSHARCHIVE - what archive to sync? (Multiple mirrors behind one ssh key!)
# $PUSHCB      - do we want a callback?
# $PUSHKIND    - whats going on? are we doing mhop push or already stage2?
# $FROMFTPSYNC - set to true if we run from within ftpsync.
#
# This function assumes that the variable LOG is set to a directory where
# logfiles can be written to.
# Additionally $PUSHLOCKS has to be defined as a set of space delimited strings
# (list of "lock"files) to wait for if you want pushtype=staged
#
# Pushes might be done in background (for type all).
