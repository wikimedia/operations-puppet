# We want to be able to get told what kind of sync we should do. This
# might be anything, from the archive to sync, the stage to do, etc. A
# list of currently understood and valid options is below. Multiple
# options are seperated by space. All the words have to have the word
# sync: in front or nothing will get used!
#
# Option        Behaviour
# stage1		 Only do stage1 sync
# stage2		 Only do stage2 sync
# all			 Do a complete sync
# mhop           Do a mhop sync, usually additionally to stage1
# archive:foo    Sync archive foo (if config for foo is available)
# callback       Call back when done (needs proper ssh setup for this to
#                work). It will always use the "command" callback:$HOSTNAME
#                where $HOSTNAME is the one defined below/in config and
#                will happen before slave mirrors are triggered.
#
# So to get us to sync all of the archive behind bpo and call back when
# we are done, a trigger command of
# "ssh $USER@$HOST sync:all sync:archive:bpo sync:callback" will do the
# trick.

Hello admin,

i found that there is a new version of me available.
Me lonely ftpsync is currently version: ${VERSION}
New release of myself is available as:  ${LATEST}

Me, myself and I - and the Debian mirroradmins - would be very grateful
if you could update me. You can find the latest version on your mirror,
check $(hostname -s):${TO}/project/ftpsync/ftpsync-${LATEST}.tar.gz

You can ensure the validity of that file by using sha512sum or md5sum
against the available checksum files secured with a signature from the
Debian FTPMaster signing key.
