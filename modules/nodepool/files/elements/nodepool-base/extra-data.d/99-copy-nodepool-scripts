# Copy the nodepools scripts into the image

# This is 99 because it needs to depend on source-repositories having been
# run, because the default fallthrough location for the nodepool scripts
# is the git repo that's been cloned into the image.

# During a nodepool run, it's expected that NODEPOOL_SCRIPTDIR is set, in
# which case ordering doesn't matter - but for a developer hacking locally
# who is not hacking on those scripts, it's an imposition to make them
# set an env var.
