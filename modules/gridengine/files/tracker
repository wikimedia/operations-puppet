#
# This script maintains live configuration by tracking the files
# in 'dir' by performing the following three actions:
#
# * A file that exists in dir that does not exist in trackdir
#   will perform 'addcmd' on the file, then put 'delcmd file'
#   in a file of the same name in trackdir.
#
# * A file name that exists in both directories will and is
#   newer in dir than it is in tracker will perform
#   modcmd on the file and rewrite 'delcmd file' to the
#   one in trackdir (thus updating its timestamp)
#
# * A file in trackdir that does not have a corresponding
#   file in dir, run the content of the file then remove
#   it if succesful.
#

### XXX: RIGHT NOW THIS ONLY ECHOS THE COMMANDS TO AVOID
###      CHANGING THE RUNNING CONFIGURATION.  THIS SCRIPT
###      IS JUST A NOISY NOOP.
