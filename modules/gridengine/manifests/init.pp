# gridengine/init.pp
#
# The gridmaster parameter is used in the template to preseed the package
# installation with the (annoyingly) semi-hardcoded FQDN to the grid
# master server.
#
# $etcdir *needs* to be shared between all instances that are
# part of the grid; normally it should reside on a network
# filesystem.
#
# This is also normally a requirement of a HA installation of
# gridengine, and the default for Tool Labs (which bind mounts
# /var/lib/gridengine to a subdirectory of /data/project).
#
# Annoyingly, $etcdir is set in several places all over the module
# because there is no (reliable) way to have defines reuse the
# definition.  If you change it here, you must change it everywhere.
