# Class: toollabs::compute
#
# This role sets up a grid compute node in the Tool Labs model.

# On its own, this sets up a working node of the grid, but it is
# useless without a more specific role from toollabs::node::* that
# will add functionality and place it on queues or hostgroups.
#
# Parameters:

# Actions:

# Requires:

# Sample Usage:
