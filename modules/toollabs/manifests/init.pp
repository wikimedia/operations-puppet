    # The $store is an incredibly horrid workaround the fact that we cannot

    # information in a shared filesystem that are collected locally into
    # files to finish up the configuration.
    #
    # Case in point here: SSH host keys distributed around the project for
    # known_hosts and HBA of the execution nodes.
