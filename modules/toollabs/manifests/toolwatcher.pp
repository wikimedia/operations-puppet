# toollabs::toolwatcher sets up a host with a service that scans every
# two minutes for tool accounts whose home directory doesn't exist
# yet.  For each such tool account, the toolwatcher creates the home
# directory with the subdirectory public_html owned by the tool
# account and its group and sets the permissions to g+srwx,o+rx.
