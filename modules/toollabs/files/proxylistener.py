"""
Simple TCP server that keeps routes in the Redis db for authenticated requests.

The routes are kept as long as the socket making the request is open, and cleaned
up right afterwards. identd is used for authentication - while normally that is
a terrible idea, this is okay in the toollabs environment because we only have
a limited number of trusted admins. This also allows routes to be added
only for URLs that are under the URL prefix allocated for the tool making the
request. For example, a tool named 'testtool' can ask only for URLs that
start with /testtool/ to be routed to where it wants.

The socket server is a threaded implementation. Python can not be truly parallel
(hello, GIL!), but for our purposes it is good enough.
