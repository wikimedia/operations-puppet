This dir contains a bunch of half-baked scripts that are useful when
rebooting a virt node or otherwise restarting tools instances.

Here's an example workflow for rebooting a nova-compute node:




t - 24h
-------
- Gather up list of tools nodes to be rebooted into <hostlist>. An example list
would look like: tools-exec-1205 tools-exec-1404 tools-webgrid-lighttpd-1205
- Log in to tools-master and:
  $ dequeugridnodes.sh <hostlist>


t - 23h
---------
- Notify users about persistent (hence endangered) jobs by logging into tools-master and:
  $ runninggridtasks.py <hostlist> > jobs.yaml
  $ runningridjobsmail.py

t - 10 mins or so
-------
- Log into tools-bastion and:
  $ killgridjobs.sh <hostlist>
- check if continuous jobs died in this process; if so, we'll need another way to do this.

(when servers have restarted)
--------
- Enable queues by logging into tools-master and:
  $ requeuegridnodes.sh <hostlist>
