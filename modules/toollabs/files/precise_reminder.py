        Ubuntu Precise was released in April 2012, and support for it
        (including security updates) will cease in April 2017. We need to shut
        down all Precise hosts before the end of support date to ensure that
        Tool Labs remains a secure platform.

        You (username: {}) are registered as admin/maintainer for the following tools,
        that are still on Precise: \n{}

        Please make sure to migrate these over to Trusty as early as possible, to
        ensure continued operation.

        The steps to migrate to Trusty, and more information about the
        Precise deprecation are here -
        https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Tools_Precise_deprecation#What_should_I_do.3F.

        A quick tip for webservices - running `webservice stop; webservice start` -
        will migrate it to trusty (webservice restart currently sticks).
        Additional information on running precise jobs can be seen at our Precise tools
        dashboard here - https://tools.wmflabs.org/precise-tools/
