# WAY too many things depend on this being run on a exec submit host
# This is used by tools that want to run a shell script that would
# launch jobs themselves. Since exec nodes are not submit nodes themselves
# and a lot of tools use this already, keep this up for now. Hopefully
# someone someday finds those tools, tells the authors to fix it up and
# then we can remove this.
