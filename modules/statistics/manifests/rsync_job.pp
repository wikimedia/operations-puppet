# == Define: statistics::rsync_job
#
# Sets up a daily cron job to rsync from $source to $destination
# as the $misc::statistics::user::username user.  This requires
# that the $misc::statistics::user::username user is installed
# on both $source and $destination hosts.
#
# == Parameters:
#    source         - rsync source argument (including hostname)
#    destination    - rsync destination argument
#    retention_days - If set, a cron will be installed to remove files older than this many days from $destination.
#    ensure         - Either 'absent' or 'present'.  If absent, the rsync cron job will not exist, but if
#                     $retention_days is given, the cron to prune old logs will still exist.  Default: 'present'
#
