# == Class statistics
# Base wrapper class for stat servers.
# All stat servers should include this class.

# == Parameters
#   $servers        - list of statistics servers.
#                     These will be granted rsync read and
#                     write access between each other.
#   $working_path   - Base path for statistics data.
#                     Default: /srv
