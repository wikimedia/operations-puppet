# == Class statistics::sites::yarn
# pivot.wikimedia.org
#
# This site will be a simple reverse proxy to the nodejs service serving
# the pivot UI, used to limit the access to authenticated clients (via LDAP).
#
# Context up to September 2016:
# There is a current dispute between Imply and Metamarkets about a possible
# copyright infringement related to Imply's pivot UI.
# The Analytics team set a while back a goal to provide a Pivot UI
# to their users with the assumption that all the code
# used/deployed was open souce and freely available. If this assumption will
# change in the future, for example after a legal sentence, the Analytics team
# will take the necessary actions.
# For any question please reach out to the Analytics team:
