${script_name} [-h] [-v] [-n] [-t <base-temp-directory>] SRC1 [SRC2] ... DEST

OPTIONS:
  -h  Print this usage message
  -v  Enable verbose logging of shell commands that are run
  -n  perform a dry run with no changes made
  -t  The base directory to create temp directories in.  Default: /tmp

DESCRIPTION:
  Syncs multiple source directories into a final destination directory
  using hard links. The final destination directory will be
  re-created from the source directories each run of this command.
  The original destination directory will be moved away and the newly
  created and hardlink synced destination directory will be moved to its place.
  The original will then be deleted.  Since all of this uses hard links
  (via cp -al), the extra 'copies' of these directories will not take
  up (much) additional filesystem space.

  All directories (temp, sources, and destination) must be on
  the same filesystem, otherwise hardlinks would not work.

  ${script_name} is useful if you want to present the contents of multiple
  directories as one, but still want to allow people to delete contents out
  of the source directories.  If it weren't for the delete problem, rsync
  would be sufficient to solve this problem.

EXAMPLE:
  ${script_name} /my/dir1 /my/dir2 /my/dest

  This will copy the contents of /my/dir1/* and /my/dir2/* into
  /my/dest/ as hardlinks.  WARNING: /my/dest as is before
  this command runs will be deleted.  A new /my/dest will be moved
  into its place containing a fresh hardlink sync from the
  source directories.
