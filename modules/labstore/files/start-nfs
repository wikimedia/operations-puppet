The exportred filesystem between labstore1001 and labstore1002 are on a
single directly attached storage array.  Having both run at the same time
WILL break things!  Only start NFS here if the other server is powered
down or in single-user mode *and* has not mounted any of the attached
filesystems.

To proceed, type: I am absolutely certain!
