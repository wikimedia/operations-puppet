    # not in trusty where support for namespaces is incomplete) and was the source for
    # several local privilege escalation vulnerabilities. Fortunately the 3.13.0-91 release
    # introduced a backport of the Debian patch allowing to disable the creation of user
    # namespaces via a sysctl. There's a few servers we haven't been able to migrate to
    # that kernel for technical reasons, so make the creation of the sysctl dependant on
    # the kernel release.
