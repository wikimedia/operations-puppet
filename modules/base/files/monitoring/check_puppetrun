# A simple nagios check that should be run as root an
# can check when the last run was done of puppet.
# It can also check fail counts and skip machines
# that are not enabled
#
# The script will use the puppet last_run-summary.yaml
# file to determine when last Puppet ran else the age
# of the statefile.
#
# This script has two modes.  By default it only checks for
# when the most recent run was completed, and warns/fails based
# on how long ago that was, using the thresholds '--critical' and '--warning'
# in seconds.
#
# In the second mode, with "--check-failures", this script will warn or fail
# depending on if the total number of puppet failures excees the values set
# with '--critical' and '--warning'
