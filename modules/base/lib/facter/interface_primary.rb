# Fact: interface_primary
#
# Purpose: Determine the primary network interface
#
# Resolution:
#
#   Returns the primary network interface, i.e. the interface which is used
#   to reach the default gateway of the system.
#
#   Note that this is obsolete with recent version of facter (> 3) and the
#   networking structured fact.

    # Pick the interface used to reach the default IPv4 gateway.  The IPv6 gw
    # may or may not be reachable through the same interface, so technically
    # this is "interface4_primary", but that's a corner-case that we currently
    # do not need to handle.

    # ifconfig instead of iproute and does not filter out deprecated
