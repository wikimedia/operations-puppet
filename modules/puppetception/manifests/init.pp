# == Class: puppetception
#
# Puppetception is an easy way to setup a labs project that
# uses a puppet repository that is *not* operations/puppet.git.
# This is for volunteer projects that want to use a puppetied
# environment but find it too hard to use operations/puppet or
# already have a puppet repository they want to reuse.
#
# The class sets up a git clone of the specified repository
# at the specified path, and auto pulls it to the specified
# branch on each run. Also provides a 'puppetception' command
# that when run will run puppet on the cloned repository.
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*git_url*]
#   The url to the git repository containing the puppet files
#   the project wants to use
#
# [*git_branch*]
#   The name of the git branch to pull.
#   Defaults to 'master'
#
# [*puppet_subdir*]
#   The name of the dir inside the repository where the puppet
#   files reside. This is useful if the remote repo contains
#   other files unrelated to puppet, and the puppet files are
#   in one particular subfolder.
#
# [*owner*]
#   The user who should own the cloned repository.
#   Defaults to 'root'
#
# [*group*]
#   The group that the cloned repository belongs to.
#   Defaults to 'root'
#
