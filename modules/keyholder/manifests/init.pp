# == Class: keyholder
#
# The keyholder class provides a means of allowing a group of trusted
# users to use a shared SSH identity without exposing the identity's
# private key. This is accomplished by running a pair of SSH agents
# as system services: `keyholder-agent` and `keyholder-proxy`:
# `keyholder-agent` is the actual ssh-agent instance that holds the
# private key. `keyholder-proxy` proxies requests to the agent via a
# domain socket that is owned by the trusted user group. The proxy
# implements a subset of the ssh-agent protocol, allowing users to list
# identities and to use them to sign requests, but not to add or remove
# identities.
#
# The two services bind domain sockets at these addresses:
#
#   /run/keyholder
#   ├── agent.sock (0600)
#   └── proxy.sock (0660)
#
# Before the shared SSH agent can be used, it must be armed by a user
# with access to the private key. This can be done by running:
#
#  $ SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/run/keyholder/agent.sock ssh-add /path/to/key
#
# Users in the trusted group can use the shared agent by running:
#
#  $ SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/run/keyholder/proxy.sock ssh remote-host ...
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*trusted_group*]
#   The name or GID of the trusted user group with which the agent
#   should be shared. It is the caller's responsibility to ensure
#   the group exists.
#
# === Examples
#
#  class { 'keyholder':
#      trusted_group => 'wikidev',
#      require       => Group['wikidev'],
#  }
#
# === Bugs
#
# It is currently only possible to have a single agent / proxy pair
# (shared with just one group) on a particular node.
