# == Define: grafana::dashboard
#
# Provisions a Grafana dashboard definition. Grafana dashboards may
# be defined via the web interface, or by placing a JSON dashboard
# definition in Grafana's dashboard directory. This resource is meant
# to help you do the latter.
#
# The Grafana JSON format is not documented, but you can see what
# it looks like by creating or loading a dashboard in Grafana and
# then using the "export" feature to see the dashboard's JSON
# representation.
#
# === Parameters
# [*ensure*]
#   Set to 'present' to add a dashboard, set to 'absent' to remove
#   a dashboard. 'present' by default.
#
# [*content*]
#   If defined, will be used as the content of the dashboard JSON
#   file. Undefined by default. Mutually exclusive with 'source'.
#
# [*source*]
#   Path to file containing JSON dashboard definition. Undefined
#   by default. Mutually exclusive with 'content'.
#
# === Examples
#
#  grafana::dashboard { 'reqerror':
#    source => 'puppet:///modules/varnish/dashboards/reqerror.json',
#  }
#
