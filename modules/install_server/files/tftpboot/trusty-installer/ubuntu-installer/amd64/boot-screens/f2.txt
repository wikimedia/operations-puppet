You must have at least 44 megabytes of RAM to use this Ubuntu installer.

You should have space on your hard disk to create a new disk partition
of at least 5 gigabytes to install a standard Ubuntu desktop system or
at least 500 megabytes for a minimal server installation. You'll need
more disk space to install additional packages, depending on what you
wish to do with your new Ubuntu system.

See the Installation Guide or the FAQ for more information; both
documents are available at the Ubuntu web site, 0fhttp://www.ubuntu.com/07
