If you can't install Ubuntu, don't despair! The Ubuntu team is ready to
help you! We are especially interested in hearing about installation
problems, because in general they don't happen to only 0fone07 person.
We've either already heard about your particular problem and can dispense a
quick fix, or we would like to hear about it and work through it with you,
and the next user who comes up with the same problem will profit from your
experience!

See the Installation Guide or the FAQ for more information; both
documents are available at the Ubuntu web site, 0fhttp://www.ubuntu.com/07
