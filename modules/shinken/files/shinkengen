"""
Generates config about labs instances for shinken, taking info from OpenStack and our puppetmaster.

Emits a host definition for each instance in the whitelisted projects
(whitelist in the config file).

Sets as hostgroup for each instance:
    - Name of project instance is a part of
    - role::labs::instance
    - Each puppet role explicitly applied to it (via Wikitech)

Sets as contact for each instance a contactgroup with the same name as the
project the instance is in. This contactgroup must be created whenever a
new project is whitelisted.

Sets the project name in the notes section of each instance, so that
can be used when constructing graphite metric paths.
