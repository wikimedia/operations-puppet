# == Class: protoproxy::ocsp_updater
#
# This class defines a machine-global cronjob which updates
# any existing OCSP files in /var/cache/ocsp once every two
# hours, randomly splayed per-machine.
#
# It is intended to be used as "include protoproxy::ocsp_updater"
# any time an ocsp file is defined for creation on a given machine.
# See protoproxy::localssl for example.
#
# Note that everything about how we time/check this stuff today makes
# assumptions based on GlobalSign's OCSP validity time windows.  In the
# future, it would be better to find a way to make the cron/check -timing
# a bit more adaptive...
