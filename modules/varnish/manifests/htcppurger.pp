# == Class: varnish::htcppurger
#
# Creates a vhtcpd daemon on the host, which relays "HTCP" multicast packets
# into PURGEs to local varnish instances.
#
# === Parameters:
# [*mc_addrs*]
#   Required - Array of multicast addresses to subscribe.
#
# [*varnishes*]
#   Array of 'IP:Port' for local varnish instances to forward to, defaults to
#   ports 80 and 3128 on localhost (our standard 2layer frontend + backend
#   instances).
#
# === Multicast assignments:
#   239.128.0.112 - text (legacy: all HTCP used this address)
#   239.128.0.113 - upload
#   239.128.0.114 - maps
#
#  --
#  Note that due to low-level details of how multicast works, it's best if we
#  avoid assigning separate multicast addressess anywhere in our
#  infrastructure which are identical in the bottom 23 bits and differ only in
#  the top 5 bits (the IPv4 multicast space is 28 bits total), as those will
#  effectively alias each other at layer 2 even if they're filtered and used
#  independently at higher layers...
#  We should probably start registering and tracking the multicast we use
#  somewhere centrally...
