/******************************************************************************
 * normalize_path_encoding(): URL-Path (not Query!) normalization
 *
 * This function requires as input a "decoder_ring", which must be a pointer
 * to a 256-element array of size_t elements.  The indices are the 256
 * possible byte values, and the values control the normalization of the given
 * character in the URL path.  Legal values are currently 0, 1, and 2:
 *
 * 0 -> Always encode this character as a hex escape (%XX)
 * 1 -> Always decode a hex escape representing this character back into the
 *      literal character byte.
 * 2 -> Do not change the encoding of this character, allowing both forms to
 *      pass through.
 *
 * The parsing of the input URL's existing hex escapes is case-insensitive
 * (%AB == %ab == %Ab == %aB).  All hex escapes in the final normalized URL
 * are normalized to upper case hex digits, even if they didn't need any other
 * normalization transformation (even case "2" above).
 *
 * RFC 3986 splits the 256 possible byte values completely into 3 sets:
 * 66 Unreserved: 0-9 A-Z a-z - . _ ~
 * 18 Reserved: : / ? # [ ] @ ! $ & ' ( ) * + , ; =
 * 172 Disallowed: 0x00-0x20 0x7F-0xFF < > | { } " % \ ^ `
 *
 * As a generic URL normalizer without application-specific knowledge, the best
 * one can do at normalization by the RFC rules is:
 * * Unreserved: always decode (array value 1)
 * * Reserved: do not touch (array value 2)
 * * Disallowed: input is malformed if these exist, but encoding them is best
 *               reasonable option in that case (array value 0)
 *
 * A generic normalizer that matches the above values is provided as
 * "generic_decoder_ring" below which can be used as the decoder_ring argument.
 *
 * More-specific decoder rings which increase the amount of normalization can
 * be built with application-specific knowledge, while still conforming to
 * RFCs, by changing some of the Reserved set's 2s into 0s or 1s as warranted.
 *
 * Note that since we're specifically operating on the Path component, which is
 * delimited by literal '?' or '#', that these Reserved characters should not
 * be changed from their 2 value given in the generic_decoder_ring definition.
 * Changing them to 0 will do nothing due to implementation details (which
 * could change in the future!), and changing them to 1 would break the
 * normalized interpretation.
 *
 * Therefore, there are 16 reasonable characters, all from Reserved, that
 * custom application-specific decoders can set to 0 or 1 instead of their
 * default value of 2 from the generic_decoder_ring, if warranted.  We'll call
 * these 16 the Customizable Set:
 * : / [ ] @ ! $ & ' ( ) * + , ; =
 *
 * Changing any others (Unreserved, Disallowed, ?, or #) outside of the
 * Customizable set to values other than those shown in the
 * generic_decoder_ring is allowed by the code, but will almost certainly lead
 * to broken or buggy URL normalization.
