  #   A self-signed (snakeoil) certificate can be created by installing

  #   /usr/share/doc/apache2.2-common/README.Debian.gz for more info.
  #   If both key and certificate are stored in the same file, only the

  #   SSL Protocol Adjustments:
  #   The safe and default but still SSL/TLS standard compliant shutdown
  #   approach is that mod_ssl sends the close notify alert but doesn't wait for
  #   the close notify alert from client. When you need a different shutdown
  #   approach you can use one of the following variables:
  #   o ssl-unclean-shutdown:
  #     This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no
  #     SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates
  #     the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use
  #     this when you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where
  #     mod_ssl sends the close notify alert.
  #   o ssl-accurate-shutdown:
  #     This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a
  #     SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify
  #     alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in
  #     practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use
  #     this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation
  #     works correctly.
  #   Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP
  #   keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable
  #   keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable "nokeepalive" for this.
  #   Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to workaround
  #   their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables "downgrade-1.0" and
  #   "force-response-1.0" for this.
  BrowserMatch "MSIE [2-6]" \
  nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
  downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
  # MSIE 7 and newer should be able to use keepalive
  BrowserMatch "MSIE [17-9]" ssl-unclean-shutdown
