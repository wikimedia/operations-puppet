A benchmark is a piece of Javascript that can be run with the
  jsbench --benchmark <benchmark> <url>
command. The script will be executed when the browser opens the page.
It needs to contain a console.profile and a console.profileEnd call;
otherwise it can be arbitrary. The output of the profileEnd call will be
returned by jsbench.
