# Classes for Zookeeper nodes.
# These role classes will configure Zookeeper properly in either
# the labs or production environments.
#
# Usage:
#
# If you only need Zookeeper client configs to talk to Zookeeper servers:
#   include role::zookeeper::client
#
# If you want to set up a Zookeeper server:
#   include role::zookeeper::server
#
# == Class role::zookeeper::server
#
# zookeeper_cluster_name in hiera will be used to make jmxtrans
# properly prefix zookeeper statsd (and graphite) metrics.
#
