# Classes for Zookeeper nodes.
# These role classes will configure Zookeeper properly in either
# the labs or production environments.
#
# Usage:
#
# If you only need Zookeeper client configs to talk to Zookeeper servers:
#   include role::zookeeper::client
#
# If you want to set up a Zookeeper server:
#   include role::zookeeper::server
#
#
# You need to include the hiera variable 'zookeeper_hosts' as a
# assoc array with key being name of node and value being zookeeper id
# for the client / server roles to work.

# == Class role::zookeeper::client
#
class role::zookeeper::client {
