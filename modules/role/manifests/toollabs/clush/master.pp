# = Class: role::toollabs::clush::master
#
# Clush master for toollabs. Allows orchestrating remote
# command execution on classes of toollabs instances. Hits
# the wikitech API to do discovery of all instances in
# toollabs. They are then classified by prefix using a list,
# maintained in modules/role/files/toollabs/clush/toollabs-clush-generator.py.
#
# You'll have to be a member of tools.admin to run this. All accesses
# are logged to /var/log/clush.log.
#
# For example, to run a command on all the kubernetes workers,
#  $ clush -g k8s-worker -b 'uname -r'
#
# This will run it on all the k8s-workers, collect the output
# from them all (the -b option), dedupes them and displays them. You can specify fanout with -f - the default is 16.
