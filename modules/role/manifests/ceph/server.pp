# Class: role::ceph::server
#
# Sets up a Ceph server with co-located services
#
# Note: This role supports the installation of the new Ceph
# cluster being undertaken principally by the Data Engineering
# team in #T324660
#
# Initially comprising five hosts, all Ceph services (osd, mon,
# radosgw, mds) will be running on the same hosts. At a later
# date we may split out these functions and use dedicated
# hardware for specific roles. That is the reason for the
# generic naming of this role.
