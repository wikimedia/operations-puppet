# == Class role::cache::kafka::webrequest
# Sets up a varnishkafka instance producing varnish
# webrequest logs to the analytics Kafka brokers in eqiad.
#
# == Parameters
# $topic            - the name of kafka topic to which to send messages
# $varnish_name - the name of the varnish instance to read shared logs from.  Default 'frontend'
# $varnish_svc_name - the name of the init unit for the above, default 'varnish-frontend'
#

    # Background task: T136314
    # Background info about the parameters used:
    # 'q':
    # 1) Filter out PURGE requests and Pipe creation traffic.
    # 2) A Varnish log containing Timestamp:Pipe does not carry Timestamp:Resp,
    # used by Analytics to bucket data on Hadoop and for data consistency
    # checks. These requests indicate that Varnish tried to establish a pipe
    # channel between the client and the backend, an information that
    # can be discarded.
    # Websockets upgrade usually lead to long lived requests that trigger
    # VSL timeouts as well. Varnishkafka does not have a nice support for
    # these use cases, moreover we haven't decided yet if weberequest logs
    # will need to take them into account or not.
    # At the moment these requests get logged incorrectly and with partial
    # data (due to the VSL timeout) so it makes sense to filter them out to
    # remove noise from Analytics data.
    # 3) A request marked with the VSL tag 'HttpGarbage' indicates unparseable
    # HTTP requests, generating spurious Varnish logs.
    # 'T':
    # VLS API timeout is the maximum time that Varnishkafka will wait between
    # "Begin" and "End" timestamps before flushing the available tags to a log.
    # When a timeout occurs most of the times the result is a webrequest log
    # missing values like the end timestamp.
    #
    # VSL Timeout parameters modified during the upload migration:
    # 'L':
    # Sets the upper limit of incomplete transactions kept before the oldest
    # one is force completed. This setting keeps an upper bound
    # on the memory usage of running queries (Default: 1000).
    # A change in the -T timeout value has the side effect of keeping more
    # incomplete transactions in memory for each varnishkafka query (in our case
    # it directly corresponds to a varnishkafka instance running).
    # The threshold has been raised to '5000' the first time (which removed
    # the bulk of the timeouts) and to '10000' the second time.
    # 'T':
    # Raised the maximum timeout for incomplete records from '700' to '1500'
    # after setting the -L to '5000'. VSL timeouts were masked
    # by VSL store overflow errors.
