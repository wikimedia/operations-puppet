    # Kafka main clusters are still on 0.9, so we can't colocate MirrorMaker alongside
    # of the newer 0.11 brokers in the jumbo cluster.  We want to do this, but we have
    # to wait until the main Kafka clusters are upgraded, which might be a while.
    # For now, we mirror main cluster topics to jumbo by including
    # profile::kafka::jumbo::mirror elsewhere on nodes with older Kafka client versions.
