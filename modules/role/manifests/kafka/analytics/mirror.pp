# == Class role::kafka::analytics::mirror
# Defines Kafka MirrorMaker instances to mirror
# all other Kafka cluster data into the analytics Kafka Cluster
#
# In production, the only other Kafka clusters
# (as of August 2016) are main-eqiad and main-codfw.
# Those clusters mirror prefixed topics to each other,
# in a 'master <-> master' (not really) setup.
# Thus, main-eqiad will have all the topics for
# itself and main-codfw.  It is sufficient
# to just mirror all topics from main-eqiad into
# analytics-eqiad.
#
# It is safe to include this class on multiple hosts.
# Each host it is included on will just fire
# up a new MirrorMaker consumer that will be auto balanced
# by Kafka.
#
class role::kafka::analytics::mirror {
    # For safety, only allow this class to be included in eqiad.

        fail('role::kafka::analytics::mirror must only be used in eqiad')

        # batch expirations.  I think is because kafka1018 has been
        # down (due to a bad disk) for a while, and is really busy
        # resyncing.  acks=all makes a batch wait for all brokers
        # in the ISR to ack, and if a single broker takes a while,
        # an exception is thrown.  This isn't the best solution,
        # we should be able to use acks=all, but for analytics purposes
        # this should be acceptable (for now).
