# == Class: role::prometheus::labs_project
#
# This class provides a prometheus server to do node (host) monitoring for all
# instances of the labs projects it is running in.
# Instance autodiscovery is accomplished by querying wikitech HTTP API for
# instances list and writing a list of <instance>:9100 'targets' for prometheus
# to pick up. See also prometheus::node_exporter.
