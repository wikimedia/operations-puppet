# == Class role::analytics_cluster::coordinator
#
# This role includes Oozie and Hive servers, as well as a MySQL instance
# that stores meta data associated with those and other
# Analytics Cluster services.
#
# This role is a launch pad for various cron based Hadoop jobs.
# Many ingestion jobs need a starting point.  Oozie is a great
# Hadoop job scheduler, but it is not better than cron
# for some jobs that need to be launched at regular time
# intervals.  Cron is used for those.  These crons
# do not use local resources, instead, they launch
# Hadoop jobs that run throughout the cluster.
#
# This roles sets up a node responsible to coordinate and orchestrate
# a Hadoop cluster equipped with tools like Camus, Hive, Oozie and
# the Analytics Refinery.
