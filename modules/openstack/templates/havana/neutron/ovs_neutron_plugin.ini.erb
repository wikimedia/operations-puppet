# (StrOpt) Type of network to allocate for tenant networks. The
# default value 'local' is useful only for single-box testing and
# provides no connectivity between hosts. You MUST either change this
# to 'vlan' and configure network_vlan_ranges below or change this to
# 'gre' or 'vxlan' and configure tunnel_id_ranges below in order for
# tenant networks to provide connectivity between hosts. Set to 'none'
# to disable creation of tenant networks.
