"""
Simple NRPE check script that checks if a particular projects' critical
instance types are spread out enough in underlying virt* hosts so that
a virt host outage doesn't take out all instances in a given class.

Note that the algorithm used for checking 'spread out enough' is super
bogus, and doesn't work when number of instances > number of virt hosts.
This should be fixed - it isn't even good enough for some of the host
classes in the test use case (Tool Labs' exec nodes).
FIXME: Find a mathematically valid definition of 'spread out enough'
       and implement it

    Classify instances in project based on prefixes.

    Uses the Nova API (accessed with passed in creds variable) to get
    a list of instances in the given project, and then classifies
    them based on a simple prefixs based algorithm, with data in the
    classifier.

    classifer is a dictionary of prefix -> classname. Each instance
    that matches $project-$prefix-* is assigned the classname. If
    none match, the node is not classified.

    Returns a dict with the following structure:
