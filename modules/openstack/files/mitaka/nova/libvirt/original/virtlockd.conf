# Logging controls
#

# Logging level: 4 errors, 3 warnings, 2 information, 1 debug
# basically 1 will log everything possible
#log_level = 3

# Logging filters:
# A filter allows to select a different logging level for a given category
# of logs
# The format for a filter is one of:
#    x:name
#    x:+name
#      where name is a string which is matched against source file name,
#      e.g., "remote", "qemu", or "util/json", the optional "+" prefix
#      tells libvirt to log stack trace for each message matching name,
#      and x is the minimal level where matching messages should be logged:
#    1: DEBUG
#    2: INFO
#    3: WARNING
#    4: ERROR
#
# Multiple filter can be defined in a single @filters, they just need to be
# separated by spaces.
#
# e.g. to only get warning or errors from the remote layer and only errors
# from the event layer:
#log_filters="3:remote 4:event"

# Logging outputs:
# An output is one of the places to save logging information
# The format for an output can be:
#    x:stderr
#      output goes to stderr
#    x:syslog:name
#      use syslog for the output and use the given name as the ident
#    x:file:file_path
#      output to a file, with the given filepath
# In all case the x prefix is the minimal level, acting as a filter
#    1: DEBUG
#    2: INFO
#    3: WARNING
#    4: ERROR
#
# Multiple output can be defined, they just need to be separated by spaces.
# e.g. to log all warnings and errors to syslog under the virtlockd ident:
#log_outputs="3:syslog:virtlockd"
#

# Log debug buffer size:
#
# This configuration option is no longer used, since the global
# log buffer functionality has been removed. Please configure
# suitable log_outputs/log_filters settings to obtain logs.
#log_buffer_size = 64

# The maximum number of concurrent client connections to allow
# over all sockets combined.
# Each running virtual machine will require one open connection
# to virtlockd. So 'max_clients' will affect how many VMs can
# be run on a host
#max_clients = 1024
