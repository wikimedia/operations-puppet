# container logfile. It is also possible to accumulate log messages
# from all lxc controllers along with libvirtd's log outputs. In this

# log_outputs from libvirtd.conf.

# The default security driver is SELinux. If SELinux is disabled
# on the host, then the security driver will automatically disable
# itself. If you wish to disable LXC SELinux security driver while
# leaving SELinux enabled for the host in general, then set this
# to 'none' instead.
