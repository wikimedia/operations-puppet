# Keystone policy exceptions
#
#  This file attempts to only include rules that differ from
#  upstream defaults.  To view the complete set of default rules
#  on a cloudcontrol node, run
#
#   oslopolicy-sample-generator --namespace keystone
#
#  To detect redundant rules in our custom config on a cloudcontrol,
#  run
#
#   oslopolicy-list-redundant --namespace keystone
#


#  Many of these rule definitions will be judged redundant by
#  oslopolicy-list-redundant but they're included to provide
#  context for the policies that follow
member_role: role:member
admin_or_member: rule:admin_required or rule:member_role

keystonevalidate_role: role:keystonevalidate
service_admin_or_keystone_validate_or_token_subject: "rule:service_or_admin or rule:token_subject or rule:keystonevalidate_role"

# We basically never want to give rights to mere project members, only
#  project admins.  So, replace this (upstream) rule with the admin_or_owner
#  rule below
# admin_or_owner: is_admin:True or project_id:%(project_id)s
admin_or_owner: is_admin:True or rule:member_role

# This is largely unused as of Ussuri:
default: rule:admin_or_member


#  There are a few reasons why we override default policies:
#
#   - permissive policies ('') to allow the nova_observer user
#     to read things
#
#   - restrictive and member policies to distinguish between
#     a project member and a project admin (these aren't present in
#     keystone but are used elsewhere)
#
#   - restrictive admin-only policies that disable features we don't
#     use in wmcs
#

# keystone can't change passwords, it regards ldap as read-only.
