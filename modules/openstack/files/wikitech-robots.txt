# (T83428) - cleanup wikitech's robot.txt
# ! THIS IS THE LABS robots.txt and handled by puppet now !
# see operations/puppet/modules/openstack/wikitech-robots.txt
#
# this way you can test changes in robots.txt in labs
# before using the production PHP file
# this was to stop manual deployments and we also puppetize
# robots.txt for other services like gitblit/doc/etc.
#
# drawback: this must be kept in sync with prod if desired
# but also gives the freedom to have different robots rules
# in labs vs. production. we are starting out with a straight
# copy/paste from production as found on labs controller
