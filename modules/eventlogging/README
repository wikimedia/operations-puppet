EventLogging
------------
EventLogging is a platform for modeling, logging and processing
arbitrary schemaed data. This Puppet module manages the configuration
of its event processing component, which comprises a suite of
services, each of which implements a different step in a data
processing pipeline. The services communicate with one another using a
publisher/subscriber model, using Kafka or 0MQ as the transport layer.
An arbitrary number of service instances running on an arbitrary
number of hosts can be freely composed to form different event
processing patterns.
