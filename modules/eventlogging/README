EventLogging
------------
EventLogging is a platform for modeling, logging and processing
arbitrary analytic data. This Puppet module manages the configuration
of its event processing component, which comprises a suite of four
services, each of which implements a different step in a data
processing pipeline. The services communicate with one another using a
publisher/subscriber model, using Ã˜MQ as the transport layer.
An arbitrary number of service instances running on an arbitrary
number of hosts can be freely composed to form different event
processing patterns.
