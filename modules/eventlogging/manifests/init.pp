# == Class: eventlogging
#
# EventLogging is a platform for modeling, logging and processing
# arbitrary analytic data. This Puppet module manages the configuration
# of its event processing component, which comprises a suite of four
# services, each of which implements a different step in a data
# processing pipeline. The services communicate with one another using a
# publisher/subscriber model, using Ã˜MQ as the transport layer.
# An arbitrary number of service instances running on an arbitrary
# number of hosts can be freely composed to form different event
# processing patterns.
