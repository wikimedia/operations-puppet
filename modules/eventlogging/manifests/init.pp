# == Class: eventlogging
#
# EventLogging is a platform for modeling, logging and processing
# arbitrary analytic data. This Puppet module manages the configuration
# of its event-processing back end.
#
# The back end comprises a suite of service types, each of which
# implements a different task:
#
# [forwarders]    Read line-oriented data via UDP and publish it on a
#                 ZeroMQ TCP socket with the same port number.
#
# [processors]    Decode raw, streaming log data into strictly-validated
#                 JSON objects.
#
# [multiplexers]  Selects multiple ZeroMQ publisher streams into a
#                 single stream.
#
# [consumers]     Data sinks. Consumers subscribe to the parsed and
#                 validated event stream and write it to some medium.
#
# These services communicate with one another using a publisher /
# subscriber model using Ã˜MQ as the transport layer. Different
# event-processing patterns can be implemented by freely composing
# multiple instances of each type, running locally or distributed across
# several hosts.
#
# The /etc/eventlogging.d file hierarchy contains instance definitions.
# It has a subfolder for each service type. An Upstart task,
# 'eventlogging/init', walks this file hierarchy and provisions a
# job for each instance definition. Instance definition files contain
# command-line arguments for the service program, one argument per line.
#
# An 'eventloggingctl' shell script provides a convenient wrapper around
# Upstart's initctl that is specifically tailored for managing
# EventLogging tasks.
