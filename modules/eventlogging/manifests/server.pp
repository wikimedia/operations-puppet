# == Class eventlogging::server
#
# Installs eventlogging package and depdendencies and
# configures this box to daemonize and run eventlogging
# services.
#
# The back end comprises a suite of service types, each of which
# implements a different task:
#
# [forwarders]    Read in line-oriented data and publish them to an output.
#
# [processors]    Decode raw, streaming log data into strictly-validated
#                 JSON objects.
#
# [multiplexers]  Selects multiple input streams and publishes them into
#                 a single output stream.
#
# [consumers]     Data sinks. Consumers subscribe to a parsed and
#                 validated event stream and write it to some medium.
#
# [reporters]     Specialized StatsD clients which report counts of all
#                 incoming  events (valid and invalid) to a StatsD host.
#                 NOTE: This only works with 0MQ processors, which are
#                 no longer used at WMF.
#
# [services]      HTTP Service that accepts events via HTTP post.
#                 The events are validated before being produced
#                 to configured output streams.
#
# These services communicate with one another using a publisher /
# subscriber model. Different event-processing patterns can be
# implemented by freely composing multiple instances of each type,
# running locally or distributed across several hosts.
#
# The /etc/eventlogging.d file hierarchy contains instance definitions.
# It has a subfolder for each service type. An Upstart task,
# 'eventlogging/init', walks this file hierarchy and provisions a
# job for each instance definition. Instance definition files contain
# command-line arguments for the service program, one argument per line.
#
# An 'eventloggingctl' (in Ubuntu) shell script provides a convenient
# wrapper around Upstart's initctl that is specifically tailored for managing
# EventLogging tasks.
#
# TODO: Port this to Jessie/Systemd.
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*eventlogging_path*]
#   Path to eventlogging codebase
#   Default: /srv/deployment/eventlogging/eventlogging
