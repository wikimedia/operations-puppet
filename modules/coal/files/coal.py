  Coal logs Navigation Timing metrics to Whisper files.

  More specifically, coal aggregates all of the samples for a given NavTiming
  metric that are collected within a period of time, and it writes the median
  of those values to Whisper files.

  See the constants at the top of the file for configuration options.

        # for each event type is on a seperate Kafka topic, and we may be at very
        # different locations on each topic.
        #
        # The key for each item in events is a timestamp that is aligned to the

        #     key = timestamp - (timestamp % 60)
