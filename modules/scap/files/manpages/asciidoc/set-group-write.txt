set-group-write(1)
==================

NAME
----
set-group-write, set-group-write2 - Make common writable by wikidev members

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'set-group-write'
'sudo set-group-write2'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `set-group-write` script will fix group permission on the common directory
so wikidev members can write to it. The script is a wrapper to call
`set-group-write2` with sufficient privileges.

`set-group-write2` is only acting on files owned by the wikidev group. It will
make sure they are group writable.

On the deployment hosts, the target is `/srv/mediawiki-staging`, on any other host
it will be the rsynced copy `/srv/mediawiki`.

OPTIONS
-------
The scripts have no options.

EXAMPLE
-------

---------------------------------------
unpriviledgeduser@host$ set-group-write
---------------------------------------

EXIT STATUS
-----------
Nothing set really.
