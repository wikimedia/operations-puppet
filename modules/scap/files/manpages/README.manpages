Man pages for our scripts are written using asciidoc which is way easier to
manage than the awkward man syntax. They are located in the ./asciidoc sub
directory.

Editing asciidocs:
------------------
The syntax is really straightforward, you should be fine by just looking at the
existing asciidocs. A cheatsheet is available online:
  http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc

Manpages requires some specific sections, see:
  http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html#X1

If you need shadow manpages (an alias to another manpage), simply pass both
titles in the NAME section (see asciidoc/set-group-write.txt for an example.

Refresh manpages:
-----------------
You will need the asciidoc software, see below in this documentation for
installation instructions.

Once you are happy with your change, run `make` to generate the manpage out of
the asciidoc. You should review your change using man ./man/somefile.1. When
you are done, git add both the asciidoc AND the resulting man page.

Vim configuration:
------------------
When using vim, it is highly recommended to use the following third party
syntax file:
   https://github.com/dagwieers/asciidoc-vim

Files should have a vim modeline to make vim load the syntax automatically:
   // vim: set syntax=asciidoc:

Installing asciidoc:
--------------------
On Mac OS X, with homebrew:

 $ brew install asciidoc

Should also install docbook

IMPORTANT: Edit your ~/.bashrc to add:
export XML_CATALOG_FILES="/usr/local/etc/xml/catalog"

 $ a2x --doctype manpage --format manpage

FAQ:
----
If you get an error like:
a2x: ERROR: "xmllint" --nonet --noout --valid "/Users/amusso/projects/operations/puppet/modules/scap/files/manpages/asciidoc/_annotated.1.xml" returned non-zero exit status 4

That is most probably because `xmllint` is unable to find the docbook catalog.
You can use XML_CATALOG_FILES to add a XML catalog.
