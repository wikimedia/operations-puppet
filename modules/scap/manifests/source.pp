# == Define scap::source
#
# Sets up scap3 deployment source on a deploy server.
# This will clone $repository at /srv/deployment/$title.
# If $scap_repository is set it will clone it at
# /srv/deployment/$title/scap.  If you set $scap_repository to true,
# this will assume that your scap repository is named $title/scap.
#
# To use this in conjunction with scap::target, make sure the $title here
# matches a scap::target's $title on your target hosts, or at least matches
# the $package_name provided to scap::target (which defaults to $title).
#
# NOTE: This define is compatible with trebuchet's deployment.yaml file.
# If trebuchet has already cloned a source repository in /srv/deployment,
# this clone will do nothing, as it only executes if .git/config
# doesn't already exist.
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*repository*]
#   Repository name in gerrit.  Default: $title
#
# [*scap_repository*]
#   String or boolean.
#
#   If you set this to a string, it will be assumed to be a repository name
#   This scap repository will then be cloned into /srv/deployment/$title/scap.
#   If this is set to true your scap_repository will be assumed to
#   live at $title/scap in gerrit.
#
#   You can use this keep your scap configs separate from your source
#   repositories.
#
#   Default: false.
#
# [*owner*]
#   Owner of cloned repository,
#   Default: trebuchet
#
# [*group*]
#   Group owner of cloned repository.
#   Default: wikidev
#
# [*base_path*]
#   Base path for deployments.
#   Default: /srv/deployment
#
# [*lvs_service*]
#   Name of the lvs service associated with this deployment, if any
#
# [*canaries*]
#   If this source has canary deployments, list those here
#
# [*hosts*]
#   If the software must be deployed to hosts not in a pool, add them here
#
# == Usage
#
#   # Clones the 'repo/without/external/scap' repsitory into
#   # /srv/deployment/repo/without/external/scap.
#
#   scap::source { 'repo/without/external/scap': }

#
#   # Clones the 'eventlogging' repository into
#   # /srv/deployment/eventlogging/eventbus and
#   # clones the 'eventlogging/eventbus/scap' repository
#   # into /srv/deployment/eventlogging/eventbus/scap
#
#   scap::source { 'eventlogging/eventbus':
#       repository         => 'eventlogging',
#       scap_repository    => true,
#   }
#
#
#   # Clones the 'myproject/myrepo' repository into
#   # /srv/deployment/myproject/myrepo, and
#   # clones the custom scap repository at
#   # 'my/custom/scap/repo' from gerrit into
#   # /srv/deployment/myproject/myrepo/scap
#
#   scap::source { 'myproject/myrepo':
