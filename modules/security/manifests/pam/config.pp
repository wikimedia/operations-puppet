# == security::pam::config ==
#
# Allows adding a PAM configuration file to the system configuration.
# viz.: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PAMConfigFrameworkSpec for syntax.
#
# The configuration files are //not// in a recursively managed puppet
# directory because system debian packages also add files there; to
# remove one you need to explicitly set it to ensure => absent
#
# Having a security::pam::config resource in the manifest implicitly
# pulls in the security::pam class.
#
# === Parameters ===
#
# [*ensure*]
#  Is the usual metaparameter, defaults to present. Valid values are 'present'
#  and 'absent'.
#
# [*content*]
#   The content of the PAM configuration file.  Either this or [*source*]
#   must be specified.
#
# [*source*]
#   The source of the PAM configuration file.  Either this or [*content*]
#   must be specified.
