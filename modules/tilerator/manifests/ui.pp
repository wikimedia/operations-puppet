# Class: tilerator::ui
#
# This class installs and configures tilerator::ui
#
# While only being a thin wrapper around service::node, this class exists to
# accomodate future tileratorui needs that are not suited for the service module
# classes as well as conform to a de-facto standard of having a module for every
# service
# NOTE: Tileratorui is a STATEFUL service. This is in contrast to all other
# services. It allows change of the configuration on the fly via the web
# interface. Specifically it is possible to change the sources as well as other
# parts of the configuration to allow insertion of jobs into the queue with
# different configuration (e.g. style) than the current one. It's been discussed
# that this needs to be revisited and done better in the future. It is rather
# innocuous right now as no users apart from an administrative user ever access
# it. tileratorui does not have an LVS service associated with it. It is
# only meant to be used through an SSH tunnel
# NOTE: The above is THE reason this service is separated from the tilerator
# service
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*conf_sources*]
#   Sources that will be added to the configuration file of the service. This
#   defines the data transformation pipeline for the tile services. The actual
#   file is loaded from the root of the source code directory.
#   (/srv/deployment/tilerator/deploy/src/)
#   Default: 'sources.prod.yaml'
#
# [*contact_groups*]
#   Contact groups for alerting.
#   Default: 'admins'
#
# [*port*]
#   Port on which tileratorui listen
#   Default: 6535
#
# [*statefile*]
#   tilerator uses this file to record last imported data file
#   used in Tilerator notification
#
# [*from_zoom*]
#   new jobs will be created from this zoom
#   used in Tilerator notification
#
# [*before_zoom*]
#   and until (but not including) this zoom
#   used in Tilerator notification
#
# [*generator_id*]
#   copy tiles from ("gen" will only produce non-empty tiles)
#   used in Tilerator notification
#
# [*storage_id*]
#   copy tiles to
#   used in Tilerator notification
#
# [*delete_empty*]
#   if tile is empty, make sure we don't store it, if it was there before
#   used in Tilerator notification
#
# [*osmosis_dir*]
#   directory in which osmosis keeps its state
#
