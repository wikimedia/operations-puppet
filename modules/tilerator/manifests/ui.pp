# Class: tilerator::ui
#
# This class installs and configures tilerator::ui
#
# While only being a thin wrapper around service::node, this class exists to
# accomodate future tileratorui needs that are not suited for the service module
# classes as well as conform to a de-facto standard of having a module for every
# service
# NOTE: Tileratorui is a STATEFUL service. This is in contrast to all other
# services. It allows change of the configuration on the fly via the web
# interface. Specifically it is possible to change the sources as well as other
# parts of the configuration to allow insertion of jobs into the queue with
# different configuration (e.g. style) than the current one. It's been discussed
# that this needs to be revisited and done better in the future. It is rather
# innocuous right now as no users apart from an administrative user ever access
# it. tileratorui does not have an LVS service associated with it. It is
# only meant to be used through an SSH tunnel
# NOTE: The above is THE reason this service is separated from the tilerator
# service
