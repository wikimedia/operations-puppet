# = Class: elasticsearch
#
# This class installs/configures/manages the elasticsearch service.
#
# == Parameters:
# - $cluster_name:  name of the cluster for this elasticsearch instance to join
#       never name your cluster "elasticsearch" because that is the default
#       and you don't want servers without any configuration to join your
#       cluster.
# - $heap_memory:   amount of memory to allocate to elasticsearch.  Defaults to
#       "2G".  Should be set to about half of ram or a 30G, whichever is
#       smaller.
# - $multicast_group:  multicast group to use for peer discovery.  Defaults to
#       elasticsearch's default: '224.2.2.4'.
# - $plugins_dir: value for path.plugins.  Defaults to /srv/deployment/elasticsearch/plugins.
# - $plugins_mandatory: list of mandatory plugins.  Defaults to undef.
# - $minimum_master_nodes:  how many master nodes must be online for this node
#       to believe that the Elasticsearch cluster is functioning correctly.
#       Defaults to 1.  Should be set to number of master eligible nodes in
#       cluster / 2 + 1.
# - $master_eligible:  is this node eligible to be a master node?  Defaults to
#       true.
# - $holds_data: should this node hold data?  Defaults to true.
# - $auto_create_index: should the cluster automatically create new indices?
#       Defaults to false.
# - $expected_nodes: after a full cluster restart the cluster will immediately
#       start after this many nodes rejoin.  Defaults to 1 but shouldn't stay
#       that way in production.  Should be set to the number of nodes in the
#       cluster.
# - $recover_after_nodes: after a full cluster restart once this many nodes
#       join the cluster it will wait $recover_after_time for this for
#       $expected_nodes to join.   If they don't it'll start anyway. Defaults to
#       1 but shouldn't stay that way in production.  Set this to however many
#       nodes would allow the cluster to limp along and continue working. Note
#       that if the cluster does come up without all the nodes it'll have to
#       create new replicas which is inefficient if the other node does come
#       back.
# - $recover_after_time: see $recover_after_nodes.  Defaults to a minute
#       because that feels like a decent amount of time to wait for the
#       remaining nodes to catch up.
# - $awareness_attributes: attributes used for allocation awareness, comma
#       separated.  Defaults to undef meaning none.
# - $row: row this node is on.  Can be used for allocation awareness.  Defaults
#       to undef meaning don't set it.
# - $rack: rack this node is on.  Can be used for allocation awareness.
#       Defaults to undef meaning don't set it.
# - $unicast_hosts: hosts to seed Elasticsearch's unicast discovery mechanism.
#       In an environment without reliable multicast (OpenStack) add all the
#       hosts in the cluster to this list.  Elasticsearch will still use
#       multicast discovery but this will keep it from getting lost if none of
#       its pings reach other servers.
# - $filter_cache_size: size of the filter cache.  See
#       www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules-cache.html
#       for possible values.  Default is 10% like the Elasticsearch default.
# - $bulk_thread_pool_capacity: queue depth for bulk actions of each node.
# - $bulk_thread_pool_executors: number of executors for bulk actions on each
#       node.
# - $statsd_host: host to send statsd data to
# - $merge_threads: Number of merge threads to use. Default 3. Set
#        to 1 if using spinning disks.
# - $load_fixed_bitset_filters_eagerly: set to false to disable loading
#        bitsets in memory when opening indices will slowdown queries but can
#        significantly reduce heap usage.
#
# == Sample usage:
#
#   class { "elasticsearch":
#       cluster_name = 'labs-search'
#   }
#
