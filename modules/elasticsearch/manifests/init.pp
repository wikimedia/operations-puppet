# = Class: elasticsearch
#
# This class installs/configures/manages the elasticsearch service.
#
# == Parameters:
# - $cluster_name:  name of the cluster for this elasticsearch instance to join
#       never name your cluster "elasticsearch" because that is the default
#       and you don't want servers without any configuration to join your
#       cluster.
# - $heap_memory:   amount of memory to allocate to elasticsearch.  Defaults to
#       "2G".  Should be set to about half of ram or a 30G, whichever is
#       smaller.
# - $multicast_group:  multicast group to use for peer discovery.  Defaults to
#       elasticsearch's default: '224.2.2.4'.
#
# == Sample usage:
#
#   class { "elasticsearch":
#       cluster_name = 'labs-search'
#   }
#
class elasticsearch($cluster_name, $heap_memory = '2G',
    $multicast_group = '224.2.2.4') {
    # Check arguments
    if $cluster_name == 'elasticsearch' {
        fail('$cluster_name must not be set to "elasticsearch"')
    }
