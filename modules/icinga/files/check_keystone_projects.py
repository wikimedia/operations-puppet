Miscellaneous keystone state monitoring:

- Ensure that certain utility projects ('admin,' 'observer')
  exist

- Make sure that all projects have their name == their id.  Various
  of our tools depend on this, but if projects are created out of
  band (e.g. via a direct commandline action) a uuid might be assigned
  instead, which can cause bad things
