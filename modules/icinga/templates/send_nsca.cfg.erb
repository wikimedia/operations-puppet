# ENCRYPTION PASSWORD
# This is the password/passphrase that should be used to encrypt the
# outgoing packets.  Note that the nsca daemon must use the same
# password when decrypting the packet!
# IMPORTANT: You don't want all the users on this system to be able
# to read the password you specify here, so make sure to set
# restrictive permissions on this config file!

# The actual password can be changed in the private repository.
# modules/passwords/manifests/init.pp
# class passwords::icinga

password=<%= @nsca_decrypt_password %>

# ENCRYPTION METHOD
# This option determines the method by which the send_nsca client will
# encrypt the packets it sends to the nsca daemon.  The encryption
# method you choose will be a balance between security and performance,
# as strong encryption methods consume more processor resources.
# You should evaluate your security needs when choosing an encryption
# method.
#
# Note: The encryption method you specify here must match the
#       decryption method the nsca daemon uses (as specified in
#       the nsca.cfg file)!!
# Values:
#  0 = None  (Do NOT use this option)
#       1 = Simple XOR  (No security, just obfuscation, but very fast)
#
#       2 = DES
#       3 = 3DES (Triple DES)
#  4 = CAST-128
#  5 = CAST-256
#  6 = xTEA
#  7 = 3WAY
#  8 = BLOWFISH
#  9 = TWOFISH
#  10 = LOKI97
#  11 = RC2
#  12 = ARCFOUR
#
#  14 = RIJNDAEL-128
#  15 = RIJNDAEL-192
#  16 = RIJNDAEL-256
#
#  19 = WAKE
#  20 = SERPENT
#
#  22 = ENIGMA (Unix crypt)
#  23 = GOST
#  24 = SAFER64
#  25 = SAFER128
#  26 = SAFER+
