# == Class: graphite::carbon_c_relay
#
# This class configures carbon-c-relay to take carbon-relay's place in
# routing metrics around using line-protocol.
#
# Two copies of carbon-c-relay are run:
# * local-relay: takes metrics on port 1903 and forwards to all configured
# carbon-cache processes on the local machine ('carbon-cache' list in config)
# * frontend-relay: listen on standard port 2003 and mirror metrics to all
# configured backends ('backends' list in config).
#
# The frontend also supports metric tapping ('teeing' data inline) and
# metric routing (no duplication) to specific clusters. Respectively via
# 'cluster_tap' and 'cluster_routes' maps c_relay_settings.
