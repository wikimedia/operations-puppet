# = Class: shiny_sever
#
# Shiny Server enables users to host and manage Shiny applications on the
# Internet. Shiny is an R package that uses a reactive programming model
# to simplify the development of R-powered web applications. Shiny Server
# can manage R processes running various Shiny applications over different
# URLs and ports.
#
# This module sets up a Shiny Server service running on port 3838 and installs
# several R packages that are necessary for Shiny applications, including some
# that have been shown in practice to be useful.
#
# **Note**: that the CRAN mirror below is configured to use the UC Berkeley
# mirror of CRAN (https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/) as it is a trusted repository
# that also supports HTTPS. The default is 'https://cloud.r-project.org', which
# provides automatic redirection to servers worldwide (sponsored by RStudio).
# For a list of CRAN mirrors, see https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html
