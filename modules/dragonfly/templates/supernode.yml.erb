  # FIXME: Regardless of the cdnPattern, dfget conntects to this port and hangs if that
  # is not possible. This is most likely a bug and I think we can work around this by just
  # giving a "random" open port - so listenPort in this case.

  # "local" let's the supernode pull from the source (docker registry) and create a cache on disk
  # "source" makes the client (dfget) request slices directly from the source (docker registy)
  # e.g. not proxying though the supernode (and no disk cache is created)
  # with "source", the downloadPort is probably not needed (no nginx fileserver)
