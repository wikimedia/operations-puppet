# Establish a cgroup with parameters and rules to enforce
#
# cgroup-lite is a dependency pulled in
# by cgroup-bin in init.  cgroup-lite
# takes care of mounting the initial cgroup
# subsystems upon boot.
#
# [*config]
#  Hash of values for cgroup settings
#
#    cgred::group {'mygrouping':
#        config => {
#            cpu => {
#                'cpu.shares' => '1',
#            },
#        }
#        rules  => [
#            '*:foo.sh subsystem /cgroup',
#        ]
#    }
#
#
# The docs say 'First rule which matches the criteria will be executed.'
#
# - This applies even across different subsystems
# - Use the '%' keyword char to apply multiple lines upon first match.
# - Keep in mind cgroups are inherited by child processes
#
# Example that results in membership only in cpu shell cgroup:
#
#  *:/bin/bash           cpu         /shell
#  *:/bin/bash           memory      /shell
#
# Example that results in membershp in cpu and memory shell cgroup:
#
#  *:/bin/bash           cpu         /shell
#  %                     memory      /shell
