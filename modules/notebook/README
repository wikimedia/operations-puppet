== Puppet module for IPython Notebook

=== What is it?

This folder contains a Puppet module for configuring an integrated, web-based
numeric computation environment (like Mathematica), based on PyLab and IPython
Notebook.

See RDoc in manifests/init.pp for a listing of various configuration options
and their default values.


=== Usage

To use the default options, you can simply add this to your manifest:

	class { 'notebook': }


=== Limitations

 * No support for IPython Cluster at the moment.
 * Somewhat limited configurability. (IPython has a lot of options..)
 * Ubuntu-specific, as it depends on Upstart and /lib/init/upstart-job.
