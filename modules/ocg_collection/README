    Collection is a MediaWiki extension that bundles wiki articles into
    books. These books can be submitted to a server running the
    ocg-collection role for rendering into PDF / ZIM / ePUB formats.

    This role uses Redis as a queueing / status system, Swift for
    backend storage, LaTeX as a renderer, and a variety of other tools
    for media manipulation.
