## storage-snapshot
##
## usage: storage-snapshot <mountpoint>
##
## This manages snapshots for the directory at <mountpoint> (which
## must be a thin volume with avaliable snapshots).  It will
## figure out the correct volume to snapshot, and invoke
## manage-snapshots to (if needed) create a new hourly snapshot
## as well as expire and discard old ones.
##
## At the end of the process, <mountpoint>/.snapshots will be
## updated with the list of currently valid snapshots.
##
## This script provides for locking to avoid more than one
## snapshot taking place at a time and making a mess of things.
##
## This script is intended to be run hourly by cron, but it
## it safe to invoke manually - it will do nothing if there is
## already a snapshot in progress or if one has already been
## taken during the current hour.
