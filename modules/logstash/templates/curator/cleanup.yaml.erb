actions:
  1:
    action: delete_indices
    description: >-
      Delete indices older than 31 days (based on index name), for <%= @prefix %>
      prefixed indices. Ignore the error if the filter does not result in an
      actionable list of indices (ignore_empty_list) and exit cleanly.
    options:
      ignore_empty_list: True
    filters:
    - filtertype: pattern
      kind: prefix
      value: <%= @prefix %>
    - filtertype: age
      source: name
      direction: older
      timestring: '%Y.%m.%d'
      unit: days
      unit_count: 31
  2:
    action: forcemerge
    description: >-
      forceMerge <%= @prefix %> prefixed indices older than 2 days (based on index
      creation_date) to 1 segments per shard.  Delay 120 seconds between each
      forceMerge operation to allow the cluster to quiesce.
      This action will ignore indices already forceMerged to the same or fewer
      number of segments per shard, so the 'forcemerged' filter is unneeded.
    options:
      max_num_segments: 1
      delay: 120
      timeout_override:
      continue_if_exception: False
    filters:
    - filtertype: pattern
      kind: prefix
      value: <%= @prefix %>
      exclude:
    - filtertype: age
      source: creation_date
      direction: older
      unit: days
      unit_count: 2
