# = Define: r_lang::cran
#
# Facilitates installation of R packages from Comprehensive R Archive Network.
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*timeout*]
#     default 300 (seconds) but may need to be larger for R packages with a
#     lot of dependencies that take time to build (e.g. tidyverse)
#
# [*ensure*]
#     default 'present' but also accepts 'absent'
#     hoping to support 'latest' eventually
#
# [*mirror*]
#     The CRAN mirror to use, by default uses automatic redirection to servers
#     worldwide (https://cloud.r-project.org) but can be overridden. Refer to
#     https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html for the full list of mirrors.
#
# [*library*]
#     default '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library', used
#     for specifying the path of the library for
#     installing the R package
#
