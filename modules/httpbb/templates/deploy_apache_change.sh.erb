  Small helper script for automating apache configuration changes rollout.
  test-file    File containing httpbb tests. By default, all tests in
               <%= @tests_dir %>/appserver are run.
  environment  either "prod" (the default) or "beta"
  --apply      Tells the script to apply the puppet change after the test, not
               just to reenable puppet
