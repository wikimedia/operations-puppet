# == Class: etcd
#
# Installs an etcd server and defines all its clustering
#
# SSL between peers is not supported at the moment as it's
# broken upstream
#
# === Parameters
# [*host*]
#   host (or IP) of the etcd server
#
# [*client_port*]
#   TCP port for the client connections
#
# [*adv_client_port*]
#   The TCP port the ETCD server will advertise to clients. Useful if you
#   proxy to etcd via nginx or some similar https terminator
#
# [*peer_port*]
#   TCP port for the cluster traffic
#
# [*cluster_name*]
#   Name of the cluster - defaults to the datacenter
#
# [*cluster_state*]
#   State of the cluster at bootstrap, if any.
#
# [*srv_dns*]
#   Domain to use for DNS-based cluster discovery.
#
# [*peers_list*]
#   When DNS-based cluster discovery is not available, provide a peers list
#
# [*use_ssl*]
#   set to true if you want to impose use of HTTPS to communicate with
#   clients
#
# [*use_client_certs*]
#   Whether to require use of SSL certificates to connect to etcd.
#
# [*heartbeat_interval*]
#   Interval (in ms) at which etcd sends heartbeats to other peers. See
#   https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/release-2.2/Documentation/tuning.md for
#   details. Default value: 100
#
# [*election_timeout*]
#   Timeout for receiving election responses. Should usually be at least 10x the
#   heartbeat_interval. See the tuning document as well for details. Should be raised
#   whenever some latencies are present. Default value: 1000
#
