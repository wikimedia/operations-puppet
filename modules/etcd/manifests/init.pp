# == Class: etcd
#
# Installs an etcd server and defines all its clustering
#
# SSL between peers is not supported at the moment as it's
# broken upstream
#
# === Parameters
# [*host*]
#   host (or IP) of the etcd server
#
# [*client_port*]
#   TCP port for the client connections
#
# [*adv_client_port*]
#   The TCP port the ETCD server will advertise to clients. Useful if you
#   proxy to etcd via nginx or some similar https terminator
#
# [*peer_port*]
#   TCP port for the cluster traffic
#
# [*cluster_name*]
#   Name of the cluster - defaults to the datacenter
#
# [*cluster_state*]
#   State of the cluster at bootstrap, if any.
#
# [*srv_dns*]
#   Domain to use for DNS-based cluster discovery.
#
# [*peers_list*]
#   When DNS-based cluster discovery is not available, provide a peers list
#
# [*use_ssl*]
#   set to true if you want to impose use of HTTPS to communicate with
#   clients
#
# [*use_client_certs*]
#   Whether to require use of SSL certificates to connect to etcd.
