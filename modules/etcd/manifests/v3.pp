# == Class: etcd::v3
#
# Installs an etcd 3 server and defines all its clustering. Some sane defaults are
# assumed - for instance TLS is enforced between nodes and with the client.
#
# Things not covered here and that will need an external management:
# * RBAC (both v3 with native RBAC and v2 with a tls proxy)
# * SSL certificate management. You'll have to provide those
# * Monitoring/alerting
#
# === Parameters
# [*member_name*]
#   The name of the peer inside the cluster. Defaults to the hostname
#
# [*client_listen_host*]
#   Host on which we will listen for client connections
#
# [*client_listen_ip*]
#   IP on which we will listen for client connections
#
# [*peer_listen_host*]
#   Host on which we will listen for client connections
#
# [*peer_listen_ip*]
#   IP on which we will listen for peer connections
#
# [*adv_client_port*]
#   The TCP port the ETCD server will advertise to clients. Useful if you
#   proxy to etcd via nginx or some similar https terminator while we move to
#   using the v3 storage.
#
# [*max_latency_ms*]
#   Maximum network RTT between nodes, in milliseconds
#
# [*cluster_name*]
#   Name of the cluster - defaults to the domain
#
# [*cluster_state*]
#   State of the cluster at bootstrap, if any.
#
# [*srv_dns*]
#   Domain to use for DNS-based cluster discovery.
#
# [*peers_list*]
#   When DNS-based cluster discovery is not available, provide a peers list as a string
#
# [*use_client_certs*]
#   Whether to require use of SSL certificates to connect to etcd.
#
# [*trusted_ca*]
#   Path of the ca file to use. Default /etc/etcd/ssl/ca.pem
#
# [*client_cert*]
#   Path to the cert file to use for client connections.
#
# [*client_key*]
#   Path to the private key file to use for client connections.
#
# [*peer_cert*]
#   Path to the cert file to use for client connections.
#
# [*peer_key*]
#   Path to the private key file to use for client connections.
