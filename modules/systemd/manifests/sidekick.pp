# == systemd::sidekick ==
#
# Allows defining "systemd sidekicks" - i.e. units that bind their
# execution to another unit.
#
# It can be used instead of the ExecPreStart / ExecPostStop stanzas
# for operations that don't need to block spawning the service.
#
# Idea and naming are borrowed from CoreOS, see
# https://coreos.com/fleet/docs/latest/launching-containers-fleet.html#run-a-simple-sidekick
#
# We prefer convention over configuration, so this define will require
# you to respect those in order to work.
#
# === Paramenters ===
#
# [*ensure*]
#  Is the usual metaparameter, defaults to present. Valid values are 'present'
#  and 'absent'.
#
# [*parent*]
#  The parent unit we're linking this sidekick to. Should be the name of a
#  base::service_unit resource.
#
# [*start*]
#  The script to execute on start. If it doesn't start with an absolute path,
#  it will be executed with /bin/bash -c
#
# [*stop*]
#  The script to execute on stop. If it doesn't start with an absolute path,
#  it will be executed with /bin/bash -c
#
