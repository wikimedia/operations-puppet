# Make /etc/init/mysql managed by puppet. This allows us to make quick
# changes to harden the wrapper without rebuilding the custom wmf-mariadb10
# package
# Once all trusty dbs are gone, we can hopefully discard init.d in favour
# of a custom systemd service unit
#
# Default behavior is for the service to be unmanaged and manually
# started/stopped.
# It is important to keep this like this for all production services (if
# mysql and replication start automatically and there has been a crash
# or an upgrade (hardware or software), data will get corrupted).
# However, for non critical services (beta, other small, non-dedicated
# services, we allow mysql to auto-start.
# With $manage = true this class will set $ensure and $enabled as specified.
