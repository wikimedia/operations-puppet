tcpircbot
---------

This Puppet module configures a Python script that runs as an Upstart service
and forwards messages from a TCP socket to an IRC channel. It thus functions as
a relay for intranet hosts that need to emit IRC notifications.

By default, it will connect to Freenode using SSL and listen for incoming
connections on port 9200. If the configuration specifies a CIDR range, only
clients within that range are allowed to connect. The default behavior is to
allow clients from private and loopback IPs only. Multiple CIDR ranges may be
specified as an array of values.

The defaults are sane and fit the most common use-case. There are three values
which you must specify: a nickname for your bot, a nickserv password for that
nickname, and a channel name. The nickname can be specified as the resource
name. A typical configuration looks like this:

	node mynode {
		include tcpircbot

		tcpircbot::instance { 'announcebot':
			channel  => '#wikimedia-operations',
			password => $passwords::irc::announcebot,
		}
	}

Additional configuration options are documented in manifests/init.pp and
manifests/instance.pp.

To troubleshoot, check /var/log/upstart/tcpircbot-*.log.
