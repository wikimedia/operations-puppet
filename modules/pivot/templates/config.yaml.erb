    description: Mediawiki history, cleaned and shaped to be analytics-friendly.  When using, make sure to filter first by event_entity and event_type, see documentation here: https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/Data_Lake/Mediawiki_history.  Beta means this cube is not currently being updated and the data has not been fully vetted.  The schema may change a little bit going forward, based on what people find useful from the beta phase.  We expect to take this out of beta by March, 2017.
