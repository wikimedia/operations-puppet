        # Below sets "ip token" to the same on distros that support it.  The
        # token command explicitly configures the lower 64 bits that will be
        # used with any autoconf address, as opposed to one derived from the
        # macaddr.  This aligns the autoconf-assigned address with the fixed
        # one set above, and can do so as a pre-up command to avoid ever
        # having another address even temporarily, when this is all set up
        # before boot.
        # We can't rely on the token part exclusively, though, or we'd face
        # race conditions: daemons would expect to be able to bind this
        # address for listening immediately after network-up, but the address
        # wouldn't exist until the next RA arrives on the interface, which can
        # be 1-2s in practice.
        # By keeping both the static config from above and the token command,
        # we get the best of all worlds: no race, and no conflicting
        # macaddr-based assignment on the interface either.  When this is
        # first applied at runtime it will execute the token command as well,
        # but any previous macaddr-based address will be flushed.
