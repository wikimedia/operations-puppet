# Sets up a static IPv6 address on the host, based on its IPv4 address
#
# Example: for a host with an IPv4 address of 208.80.154.149, this will
# statically configure it to have an address of 2620:0:861:2:208:80:154:149.
#
# This relies on IPv6 SLAAC to be working and uses it to find the IPv6 network
# (the first 64-bits of the IPv6 address. This also doesn't touch the routing
# table and thus relies on SLAAC for configuring the default route.

    # The above sets up an "up" command to add the fixed IPv6 mapping of the v4
    # address statically, and also executes the command to add the address
    # in the present if not configured.
    #
    # Below sets "ip token" to the same on distros that support it.  The
    # token command explicitly configures the lower 64 bits that will be
    # used with any autoconf address, as opposed to one derived from the
    # macaddr.  This aligns the autoconf-assigned address with the fixed
    # one set above, and can do so as a pre-up command to avoid ever
    # having another address even temporarily, when this is all set up
    # before boot.
    # We can't rely on the token part exclusively, though, or we'd face
    # race conditions: daemons would expect to be able to bind this
    # address for listening immediately after network-up, but the address
    # wouldn't exist until the next RA arrives on the interface, which can
    # be 1-2s in practice.
    # By keeping both the static config from above and the token command,
    # we get the best of all worlds: no race, and no conflicting
    # macaddr-based assignment on the interface either.  When this is
    # first applied at runtime it will execute the token command as well,
    # but any previous macaddr-based address will be flushed.
