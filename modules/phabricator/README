Phabricator is a collection of open source web applications
that help software companies build better software.

=== Install

The first puppet pass has failures related to Phabricator processes.

The post-Puppet install process can either be finished via the configured
URL or by running the phab_update_tag which will handle the storage upgrade
for new installs in the same way it does for ongoing maintenance.

Step 1.  Puppet run with applied Phabricator class
Step 3.  phab_update_tag
Step 2.  Set the default admin user for Phabricator in the UI

At this point the Phabricator UI should indicate remaining issues.

In particular, new installs will see the warning:

  No Authentication Providers Configured

=== Administration

Recovering a password (including for the master admin account):

<phabricator_root>/bin/auth recover <username>

To see the local json values on disk:

cat <phabricator_root>phabricator/conf/local/local.json | python -m json.tool

  Or

<phabricator_root>phabricator/bin/config list

All possible values can be seen on a current install: http://<fqdn>/config/all/

=== Notable Settings Values

phabricator.base-uri            - External URL.  Should be https if we are doing SSL.
storage.default-namespace       - Changes database name prefix across all applications
test.value                      - native noop value we fill with the current tag

=== Upgrading

Phabricator is on a rolling release.  Because of this we tag and vett our own releases.

Repositories in Gerrit:

    phabricator/libphutil
    phabricator/arcanist
    phabricator/phabricator

We track a tag that should be named for the ticket associated with vetting and upgrading.

The tag needs to specified in puppet as "git_tag => 'demo'" for the Phabricator
class itself.  The same tag has to exist across all three repositories.

Adding a new tag to rollover the Production phabricator:

1.  Tag a commit id using the same tag name in all three repositories:

    git tag demo hashid

2.  Pushing tags to the gerrit server (this requires special permissions):

   git push gerrit --tags

Example output:

    * [new tag]         demo -> demo

3.  Run the upgrade script on the Phabricator host

    phab_update_tag

This script will manage setting up the migration state, upgrading the DB schema,
rolling the git repositories to the appropriate tag defined in puppet, and
returning the host to the baseline.

The upgrade process is invasive so an outage needs to be planned.

== Upgrading and versioning notes for Phabricator:

Typically, a tag will exist in the repository prior to upgrading as this same process
can be used to upgrade a host in labs for testing and validation.
