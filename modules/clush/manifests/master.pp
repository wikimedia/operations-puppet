# = Class: clush::master
#
# Sets up a clush (clustershell) master, that is designed
# to ssh into instances with the class clush::target
# installed. It sets it up to be usable only by root. Expects
# a private key of the form secret('clush/${username}') to be
# available.
#
# It sets up a default clush config that can be overriden
# on the commandline. Most important default is probably
# the fanout value of 16 - so all commands will be executed
# 16 instances at a time.
#
# == Parameters
# [*username*]
#   Username to ssh into targets as. Should match what is
#   used with clush::target
# [*ensure*]
#   Make the master be present or absent. Defaults to present
class clush::master(
    $username,
    $ensure = present,
) {
    # clush has not been vetted for use in production
    # See T143306
