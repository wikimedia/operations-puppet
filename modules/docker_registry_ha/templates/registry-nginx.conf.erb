    # Let me prefix by saying that the Docker v2 registry protocol apparently
    # is much better than the v1 protocol. I have not read enough about both
    # to make a comparative analysis, but I can tell that the auth design for
    # v2 is just terribly done!
    #
    # So for a v2 to client to decide if it needs to authenticate or not, it
    # first makes a GET request to /v2/, and based on wether it gets back a 2xx
    # or a 401, decides to authenticate for all other requests in that session.
    # This practically means it is really hard to do something like restrict
    # write access to only a certain group while allowing read access to other
    # groups - since it categorizes the whole registry based on the response
    # code of one endpoint....
    #
    # I have hacked around this in the following manner:
    #  - Tell nginx that you can be allowed by IP or by specifying a password
    #  - Allow the whole world!
    #  - Deny the IPs that need to specify password (for push and restricted pull)
    #
    # This causes nginx to return a 401 only to the IPs that have credentials, and
    # since these IPs will have the password they'll be able to authenticate. The
    # rest of the world will just be allowed via IP, and hence not be asked for
    # passwords.
    #
    # This special case handling is only for the root endpoint - all other endpoints
    # are handled in the location stanza below this, and require authentication for
    # POST/PUT/DELETE etc. We're only doing this special hack to convince the
    # docker client to send/not send basic auth credentials depending on what we
    # want them to do.
