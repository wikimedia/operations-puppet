            <p>
                Statistics compiled using the current <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Page_view" target="_blank">Pageview Definition</a>
                are available to download here, since May 2015.
                They are also available in a highly compressed format that preserves all data:
                <a href="/other/pagecounts-ez">pagecounts-ez</a>. 
                The <strong>pagecounts-ez</strong> format is ideal for anyone looking to
                download lots of pageview data, whereas the <strong>pageviews</strong> data
                is easier to use if you only want to look at a few hours.
            </p>

                The definition of a Page View linked above is stable, but may change slightly
                if we encounter problems with over or under counting.  In summary, a Page View
                is a response from our servers with a status of 200 or 304 (OK or Not Modified),
                and rendering content under the /wiki/ path or a language variant such as /zh-hant/.
                Many other details factor into this count, and the logic is slightly different for
                our mobile apps and the mobile and desktop sites.  All that is explained in the definition.

                Other ways to access the data are detailed in the definition.
                For example, we have a
                <a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#!/Pageviews_data/get_metrics_pageviews" target="_blank">Pageview API</a>
                that allows programatic access to smaller amounts of data.
                And <a href="http://tools.wmflabs.org/pageviews" target="_blank">tools to explore the data</a>.
