### Main configuration params

### Logging configuration

# enable this option if you want to send logs to local syslog facility
logging:local_syslog_logging = on

# enable this option if you want to send logs to a remote syslog server via UDP
logging:remote_syslog_logging = off

# Enable/Disable any actions in case of attack
enable_ban = on

# disable processing for certain direction of traffic
process_incoming_traffic = on
process_outgoing_traffic = off

# How many packets will be collected from attack traffic
ban_details_records_count = 500

# How long (in seconds) we should keep an IP in blocked state
# If you set 0 here it completely disables unban capability
ban_time = 1900

# Check if the attack is still active, before triggering an unban callback with this option
# If the attack is still active, check each run of the unban watchdog
unban_only_if_attack_finished = on

# enable per subnet speed meters
# For each subnet, list track speed in bps and pps for both directions
enable_subnet_counters = on

# list of all your networks in CIDR format
networks_list_path = /etc/networks_list

# redraw period for client's screen
check_period = 1

# Connection tracking is very useful for attack detection because it provides huge amounts of information,
# but it's very CPU intensive and not recommended in big networks
enable_connection_tracking = off

# Different approaches to attack detection
ban_for_pps = on
ban_for_bandwidth = on
ban_for_flows = off

# Limits for Dos/DDoS attacks
threshold_pps = 500000
threshold_mbps = 600

# Per protocol attack thresholds
# We don't implement per protocol flow limits, sorry :(
# These limits should be smaller than global pps/mbps limits

### Traffic capture methods
###

# PF_RING traffic capture, fast enough but the wirespeed version needs a paid license
mirror = off

# Netmap traffic capture (very fast but needs patched drivers)
mirror_netmap = off

# SnabbSwitch traffic capture
mirror_snabbswitch = off

# AF_PACKET capture engine
# Please use it only with modern Linux kernels (3.6 and more)
# And please install birq for irq ditribution over cores
mirror_afpacket = off

# Pcap mode, very slow and thus not suitable for production
pcap = off
# Netflow capture method with v5, v9 and IPFIX support
netflow = on
# sFLOW capture suitable for switches
sflow = off

# PF_RING configuration
# If you have a license for PF_RING ZC, enable this mode and it might achieve wire speed for 10GE

# To bind to all interfaces for all protocols:       not possible yet
# To bind to all interfaces for a specific protocol: ::  or 0.0.0.0
# To bind to localhost for a specific protocol:      ::1 or 127.0.0.1

# Netflow v9 and IPFIX agents use different and very complex approaches for notifying about sample ratio
# Here you could specify a sampling ratio for all this agents
# For NetFLOW v5 we extract sampling ratio from packets directely and this option not used
netflow_sampling_ratio = 1000

# In some cases with NetFlow we could get huge bursts related to aggregated data nature
# We could try to get smoother data with this option, i.e. we will divide counters on collection interval time

### Actions when attack detected
###

collect_attack_pcap_dumps = off

# Execute Deep Packet Inspection on captured PCAP packets

# Save attack details to Redis
redis_enabled = off

# We could store attack information to MongoDB
mongodb_enabled = off

# announce blocked IPs with BGP protocol with ExaBGP
exabgp = off

# In complex cases you could have both options enabled and announce host and subnet simultaneously

# Announce Flow Spec rules when we could detect certain attack type
# Please we aware! Flow Spec announce triggered when we collect some details about attack,
# i.e. when we call attack_details script
# Please disable exabgp_announce_host and exabgp_announce_whole_subnet if you want to use this feature
# Please use ExaBGP v4 only (Git version), for more details: https://github.com/FastVPSEestiOu/fastnetmon/blob/master/docs/BGP_FLOW_SPEC.md
