# == Class: tlsproxy::ocsp_updater
#
# This class defines a machine-global cronjob which keeps the OCSP Stapling
# files defined through tlsproxy::ocsp_stapler up to date at runtime.
#
# Note that everything about how we time/check this stuff today makes
# assumptions based on GlobalSign's OCSP validity time windows.  In the
# future, it would be better to find a way to make the cron/check -timing
# a bit more adaptive...

    # expires).
