# ----
# The commandline arguments take the form:
#
#   cat aggegrate_files* | cipher_sim.py -s server_pref_file
#
# Where "server_pref_file" is a file containing a standard OpenSSL ciphersuite
# preference list in the same form used by e.g. nginx's ssl_ciphers parameter
# on a single line, and the standard input contains aggregated clienthello
# stats (possibly catted from several files) formatted with lines as ...
#
# NNN;C1,C2,C3,...
#
# ... where "NNN" is the count of clienthellos of this type seen, and
# "C1,C2,C3,..." is the list of decimal integer ciphers those clienthellos
# indicated.  Example of 54 clienthellos which all specified exactly this list
# of 3 ciphers: "ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA, AES128-SHA, DES-CBC3-SHA"
#
# 54;49171,47,10
#
# There are no further requirements on the input data: it can contain repeats
# (which be aggregated up as they're processed), and it can contain duplicates
# in different order (which it would be more efficient to sort and aggregate
# when generating the input, but isn't strictly necessary).  If you're
# concatenating multiple aggregate files from several machines into this
# analysis script, there likely will be all sorts of repeats, and that's ok.
#
# There is a companion shellscript "cipher_cap.sh" designed to generate this
# aggregated captured data efficiently on our cp* cache machine setup today.
#
# The output of this simulator is an ordered list of the negotiated
# ciphersuites by the count and percentage (both displayed) of clients which
# would have negotiated them.  If some clients would have failed negotiation
# completely (no ciphersuites in common), they are listed as the special
# ciphersuite ":HANDSHAKE-FAILURE:".  Be aware that this is only simulating
# cipher-matching, and does not account for other forms of potential handshake
# failure such as DHE>1024 incompatibility.
#
# There is also currently a special outout ":TSHARK_BLANK:" to indicate counts
# of no cipher list at all (e.g. "54;"), which currently happens in small
# numbers with the current capture script for unknown reasons...
