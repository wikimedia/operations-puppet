"""
Dig through designate records, find and correct inconsistencies.

- Arecs that point to multiple IPs
- Arecs that resolve nova VMs that don't exist anymore
- PTRs for nova VMs that don't exist anymore

Be default this just reports on issues but with the --delete
command it will attempt to clean up as well.


Note that this is potentially racy and may misfire for instances that
are already mid-deletion.  In that case it should be safe to re-run.
