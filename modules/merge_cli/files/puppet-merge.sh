usage="$(basename "${0}") --lockout-tagout LOCKOUT_MSG

Configures Lock out, Tag out for the puppet-merge system.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockout%E2%80%93tagout


$(basename "${0}") [-y|--yes] [-p|--labsprivate] [-q|--quiet] [-d|--diffs] [SHA1]

Fetches changes from origin and from all submodules.
Shows diffs between HEAD and SHA1 (default FETCH_HEAD)
and prompts for confirmation.

If the changes are acceptable, HEAD will be fast-forwarded
to SHA1.

It also runs conftool-merge if necessary.

SHA1 equals FETCH_HEAD if not specified.

If no SHA1 is specified, and --labsprivate is not specified,
runs on both the ops and labsprivate repos.

-y / --yes: skip prompting for confirmation
-p / --labsprivate: merge only the labsprivate repo
-d / --diffs: only show diffs, don't perform any merges
-q / --quiet: don't output diffs
--lockout-tagout-override for a puppet merge even if log out tag out is in place
