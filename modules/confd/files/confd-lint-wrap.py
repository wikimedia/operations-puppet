# Confd attempts to replace each file atomically and
# can abort for safety reasons if a specified check script
# exits > 0.  This lint passes silently without running
# Confd in the console.  This wrapper runs the lint itself
# logging error output as appropriate and manages state for
# a runtime error file for monitoring. Output to stderr from
# the check script will be logged and the exit code passed up.
#
# * Confd is typically deployed with the watch keyword and as such
#   will only seek to lint and modify files irregularly.  This does
#   not lend itself well to nsca.
#
# * A global linting error is surfaced and not per template
