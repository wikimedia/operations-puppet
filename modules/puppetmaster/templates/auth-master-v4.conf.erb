# This file managed by puppet

# This is the default auth.conf file, which implements the default rules
# used by the puppet master. (That is, the rules below will still apply
# even if this file is deleted.)
#
# The ACLs are evaluated in top-down order. More specific stanzas should
# be towards the top of the file and more general ones at the bottom;
# otherwise, the general rules may "steal" requests that should be
# governed by the specific rules.
#
# See https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/config_file_auth.html
# for a more complete description of auth.conf's behavior.
#
# Supported syntax:
# Each stanza in auth.conf starts with a path to match, followed
# by optional modifiers, and finally, a series of allow or deny
# directives.
#
# Example Stanza
# ---------------------------------
# path /path/to/resource     # simple prefix match
# # path ~ regex             # alternately, regex match
# [environment envlist]
# [method methodlist]
# [auth[enthicated] {yes|no|on|off|any}]
# allow [host|backreference|*|regex]
# deny [host|backreference|*|regex]
# allow_ip [ip|cidr|ip_wildcard|*]
# deny_ip [ip|cidr|ip_wildcard|*]
#
# The path match can either be a simple prefix match or a regular
# expression. `path /file` would match both `/file_metadata` and
# `/file_content`. Regex matches allow the use of backreferences
# in the allow/deny directives.
#
# The regex syntax is the same as for Ruby regex, and captures backreferences
# for use in the `allow` and `deny` lines of that stanza
#
# Examples:
#
# path ~ ^/puppet/v3/path/to/resource    # Equivalent to `path /puppet/v3/path/to/resource`.
# allow *                                # Allow all authenticated nodes (since auth
#                                        # defaults to `yes`).
#
# path ~ ^/puppet/v3/catalog/([^/]+)$    # Permit nodes to access their own catalog (by
# allow $1                               # certname), but not any other node's catalog.
#
# path ~ ^/puppet/v3/file_(metadata|content)/extra_files/  # Only allow certain nodes to
# auth yes                                                 # access the "extra_files"
# allow /^(.+)\.example\.com$/                             # mount point; note this must
# allow_ip 192.168.100.0/24                                # go ABOVE the "/file" rule,
#                                                          # since it is more specific.
#
# environment:: restrict an ACL to a comma-separated list of environments
# method:: restrict an ACL to a comma-separated list of HTTP methods
# auth:: restrict an ACL to an authenticated or unauthenticated request
# the default when unspecified is to restrict the ACL to authenticated requests
# (ie exactly as if auth yes was present).
#

### Authenticated ACLs - these rules apply only when the client
### has a valid certificate and is thus authenticated

path /puppet/v3/environments
method find
allow *

# allow nodes to retrieve their own catalog
path ~ ^/puppet/v3/catalog/([^/]+)$
method find
allow $1
allow elnath.codfw.wmnet

# allow nodes to retrieve their own node definition
path ~ ^/puppet/v3/node/([^/]+)$
method find
allow $1

# allow all nodes to store their own reports
path ~ ^/puppet/v3/report/([^/]+)$
method save
allow $1

# Allow all nodes to access all file services; this is necessary for
# pluginsync, file serving from modules, and file serving from custom
# mount points (see fileserver.conf). Note that the `/file` prefix matches
# requests to both the file_metadata and file_content paths. See "Examples"
# above if you need more granular access control for custom mount points.
path /puppet/v3/file
allow *

path /puppet/v3/status
method find
allow *

# allow all nodes to access the certificates services
path /puppet-ca/v1/certificate_revocation_list/ca
method find
allow *

### Unauthenticated ACLs, for clients without valid certificates; authenticated
### clients can also access these paths, though they rarely need to.

# allow access to the CA certificate; unauthenticated nodes need this
# in order to validate the puppet master's certificate
path /puppet-ca/v1/certificate/ca
auth any
method find
allow *

# allow nodes to retrieve the certificate they requested earlier
path /puppet-ca/v1/certificate/
auth any
method find
allow *

# allow nodes to request a new certificate
path /puppet-ca/v1/certificate_request
auth any
method find, save
allow *

<%= @extra_auth_rules -%>

# deny everything else; this ACL is not strictly necessary, but
# illustrates the default policy.
