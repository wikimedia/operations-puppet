    # There's two issues that stop us from using ed25519 keys:
    #
    # 1) We need to still be able to collect on precise hosts and precise's
    # OpenSSH version does not support ed25519. While you'd think we could
    # export both and use a puppet collector filter to exclude type !=
    # 'ed25519', puppet's sshkey type is stupid and uses namevar for the
    # hostname and namevar is unique, so you can't define two different keys of
    # a different type for the same host. This is waiting until <= precise is
    # gone.
    #
    # 2) Puppet sshkey is also stupid in that it hardcodes acceptable types in
    # its code, and ed25519 is not a valid type in trusty's version (3.4.3). It
    # is in jessie's version (3.7.3), though. So this is waiting until <=
    # trusty is gone, or until we backport a newer version of puppet to trusty.
