Offline Content Generation
------------
... is a MediaWiki service integrating with the Collection extension
to provide article bundling and rendering for offline consumption. It
provides the 'Print to PDF' sidebar functionality as well as book
creation through Special:Book.

Render jobs are submitted to the mw-ocg-service frontend via HTTP where
they are queued in Redis. Jobs are then picked up when backend threads
are free for bundling and rendering into PDF / ZIM / ePUB documents.
Completed documents are stored on the local file system for later
retrieval (or when once it gets completed into Swift.)

The system is designed to have an LVS balancer in front of it (any
front end can respond to any request -- excepting document download.)

Configuration is under /etc/ocg
Logs are under /var/log/ocg
