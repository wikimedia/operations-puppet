# == Class: mediawiki::jobrunner::hhvm
#
# Installs and configures hhvm so that it's used to run all jobs
#
# This class will ensure that hhvm packages are installed, the fastcgi
# server is turned off and hhvm is providing /usr/bin/php via the
# alternatives mechanism. Please note that installation of the
# alternative will be taken care of by the debian package.
#
# This class should be included along with the mediawiki::jobrunner
# class that will install the runner upstart job and all the rest
# We also store the bytecode cache (which is persistent) in /run/hhvm
# which is in tmpfs as a bonus.
