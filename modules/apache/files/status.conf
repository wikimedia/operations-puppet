# Only serve /server-status on loopback interface to local requests.
#
# The default mod_status configuration enables /server-status on all
# vhosts for local requests, but it does not correctly distinguish
# between requests which are truly local and requests that have been
# proxied. Because most of our Apaches sit behind a reverse proxy, the
# default configuration is not safe, so we make sure to replace it with
# a more conservative configuration that makes /server-status accessible
# only to requests made via the loopback interface. See T113090.
