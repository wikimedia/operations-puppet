# == Define profile::prometheus::jmx_exporter
#
# Renders a Prometheus JMX Exporter config file, declares
# a prometheus::jmx_exporter_instance so that the prometheus server
# will be configured to pull from this exporter instance,
# and installs ferm rules to allow it to do so.
# The hostname:port combination, derived from the define's parameters, will
# be used as Prometheus target (so metrics will be associated to it). This trick
# should allow the configuration of multiple Prometheus targets on the same
# machine, for use cases like Cassandra (multiple JVM instances with different
# domains on the same host) or Kafka (Kafka/MirrorMaker JVMs on the same host).
#
# Parameters:
#
#  [*hostname*]
#    Hostname used by the exporter for the listen socket.
#
#  [*port*]
#    Port used by the exporter for the listen socket.
#
#  [*prometheus_nodes*]
#    List of Prometheus master nodes.
#
#  [*config_file*]
#    The full path of the configuration file to create. Check 'config_dir' for
#    more info about how its parent directory is handled.
#
# [*config_dir*]
#   The parent directory of the jmx exporter (usually /etc/prometheus). If not
#   undef or already defined, it will be created by this profile. This is only
#   a handy way to avoid code repetition while using this profile, but special
#   care must be taken since: 1) this parameter assumes a string like
#   '/etc/$name', arbitrary nesting is not currently supported 2) the $config_file
#   value needs to be set accordingly.
#   Default: undef
#
#  [*content*]
#    Content of the exporter's configuration file. One between content or source
#    must be specified.
#
#  [*source*]
#    Source content of the exporter's configuration file. One between content or
#    source must be specified.
#
#  [*labels*]
#    Hash of any common labels to be added to all metrics exported
#    from this jmx exporter instance.  NOTE: These will take precedence over
#    labels declared in prometheus::jmx_exporter_config on the prometheus
#    server.  All jobs there automatically get a 'cluster' label applied,
#    so be careful not to override that one (unless you really mean to!)
#    Default: {}
