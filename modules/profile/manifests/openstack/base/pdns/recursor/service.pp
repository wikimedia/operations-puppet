# Class: profile::openstack::pdns::recursor::service
#
# Instances can't communicate directly with other instances
#  via floating IP, but they often want to do DNS lookups for the
#  public IP of other instances (e.g. beta.wmflabs.org).
#
# This recursor does two useful things:
#
#  - It maintains a mapping between floating and private IPs
#  for select instances.  Anytime the upstream DNS server returns
#  a public IP in that mapping, we return the corresponding private
#  IP instead.  This includes a deploy-specific resolution for the
#  puppet. domain.
#
#  - It relays requests for *.wmflabs to the auth server that knows
#  about such things (defined as $labs_forward)
#
#  Other than that it should act like any other WMF recursor.
