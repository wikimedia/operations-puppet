# Define monitoring for all Anycast VIPs
# By their nature, those VIPs are advertized from several locations on the
# network. In its current state, Icinga can only alert if that IP is nowhere
# to be seen on the network. Not if the number of hosts advertizing that VIP
# falls under a certain threshold.
# The service check will only check the health of the server closest to Icinga
# in term of BGP distance (or multiple servers if load-balancing is enabled).
