# Class: profile::analytics::refinery::job::refine_sanitize
#
# Sets up RefineSanitize jobs for the analytics test cluster.
#
# Description of Refine jobs declared here:
# - event_sanitized_main
#   Sanitizes tables declared in event_sanitized_main_allowlist.yaml from
#   event -> event_sanitized db, with the keep_all hash config enabled.
#
# - event_sanitized_analytics
#   Sanitizes tables declared in event_sanitized_analytics_allowlist from
#   event -> event_sanitized db, with the keep_all hash config disabled.
#
# Parameters:
#
# [*refinery_version*]
#   Version of org.wikmidia.analytics.refinery.job refinery-job.jar to use.
#
# [*ensure_timers*]
#   Default: true
#
# [*use_kerberos_keytab*]
#   Default: true
