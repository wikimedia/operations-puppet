# Class: profile::analytics::cluster::hadoop::yarn_capacity_scheduler
#
# Capacity scheduler config tailored for the Hadoop Analytics Cluster.
# This class renders the capacity-scheduler.xml file, but it requires some options
# to be set in yarn-site.xml (via hadoop's common config) to be enabled:
#
# yarn.resourcemanager.scheduler.monitor.enable: true
# yarn.acl.enable: true
#
# This profile needs to be included on the Hadoop master nodes only.
#
# == Parameters
#
#  [*base_settings*]
#    Settings that are common/shared to all clusters that use this scheduler.
#
#  [*extra_settings*]
#    Settings that can be selectively enabled/disabled on top of the base ones.
#    It is useful when testing new properties on a single cluster (like testing)
#    before considering to add the option to the base_settings.
