# This file is needed to support the Kerberos enable procedure.
# After enabling Yarn Linux containers support, a simple map reduce job
# gets permission denied errors (and fails) due to (previously created)
# dirs on the linux fs owned by username 'yarn'.
# Containers in fact allows to run a map-reduce job as the user
# who submitted it, but this means creating log dirs etc.. not
# anymore as 'yarn'.
#
# The script can run in two modes:
# - 'user': it sets ownership of Yarn user dirs as the user who
#           created them. For example:
#           chown -R elukey /var/lib/hadoop/data/b/yarn/local/usercache/elukey
#
# - 'yarn': it sets ownership of Yarn user dirs as 'yarn'. This is
#           what normally happens when Kerberos and Linux containers
#           are not used, so it is ideal to be used in a rollback scenario.
