# before the apt run is probably more helpful than just the agent run at the
# bottom.  Also, puppet's built-in splay sleep only checks for agent-disable
# before the sleep (but not after), and does not create the agent lockfile
# until after the sleep, which creates a wide race window against tools trying
# to avoid puppet agent concurrency with the "disable and then poll lockfile".
