# MANUAL EDITS SECTION FOLLOWS. OVERRIDES CONFD ABOVE.
# NOTES:
#     1) Map-level overrides have lower precedence than service-level
#        overrides, regardless of any globbing, because the service-level is
#        the more specific of the two.
#     2) Lines are processed in-order, and the last one wins in case
#        of any direct overlap/conflict at the per-map or per-service
#        level.
#
# Examples (for manual edits):
#
#     # Disable all traffic to eqiad:
#     geoip/generic-map/eqiad => DOWN
#
#     # Disable just text-addrs, text-addrs-v4, and upload-addrs in codfw:
#     geoip/text*/codfw => DOWN
#     geoip/upload-addrs/codfw => DOWN
#
#     Disable all services except text-addrs in ulsfo:
#     geoip/generic-map/ulsfo => DOWN
#     geoip/text-*/ulsfo => UP # marks both text UP as prev example, but...
#     geoip/text-addrs-v4/ulsfo => DOWN # this overrides the above for -v4
#
# MANUAL EDITS GO BELOW THIS LINE.
