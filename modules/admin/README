This module is meant to manage all users, groups, and permissions (sudo).

All managed resources should be defined in yaml.

see: admin/data/data.yaml

-- Examples --

Adding a group:

    groups:
      mygroup:
        ensure: present
        gid: 551
        members: [foo, bar]

Managing members for a default system group:

-> For groups without a set GID we do not attempt creation

    groups:
      adm:
        members: [foo, bar]

Removing a member from a group:

-> Removing 'bar' user from mygroup means removal from members array

    groups:
      mygroup:
        ensure: present
        gid: 551
        members: [foo, bar] -> members: [foo]

Removing a group:

-> absenting a group will remove it where it was applied

    groups:
      mygroup:
        foo:
          ensure: absent
          gid: 679
          members: []

Adding user 'foo':

-> Since assignment is group centric this user won't be created anywhere yet

    users:
        foo:
          uid: 1146
          gid: 500
          realname: Foo Bar
          ssh_keys: [ssh-rsa mykeyhash foobar@mac]

# NOTE: To choose the UID for a new user please lookup
# the existing UID in (labs) LDAP and use that.
# currently you do this on terbium, example:
#
# ldaplist -l passwd someuser
# ...
# uidNumber: 1234
#
# advantages: no more duplicate UIDs that needed fixing,
# matching UID across production and labs,
# no need to grep|sort for the latest free UID anymore
# almost every user who gets prod. shell already has a
# labs user. if not, ask them nicely to make one first

# NOTE: SSH keys added to this file always need to be verified.
# acceptable methods of verification include:
# gpg signing, having them pasted on office wiki user pages,
# having them +1 by logged in gerrit users
# unacceptable methods include:
# plain email (senders can't be trusted),
# IRC (definitely if not registered/identified with nickserv)
# RT-only (because it can be emailed)

Adding user 'foo' to adm:

    groups:
        adm:
            members: [foo]

Removing user foo:

-> absented users cannot be members of a group -- other than absent --
-> users who are not a member of a supplementary group are removed
-> Therefore, removing a user from all groups means they will be removed
   everywhere they existed because of those groups.

    groups:
        adm:
          members: [foo, bar] -> members: [bar]

-> User garbage collection logs to syslog and console:

    #manual ensure absent example output
    notice: /Stage[main]/Admin/Admin::Yamluser[foo]/Admin::User[foo]/User[foo]/ensure: removed

    #straggling user cleanup puppet output
    notice: /Stage[main]/Admin/Exec[enforce-users-groups-cleanup]/returns: \
        /usr/local/bin/enforce-users-groups removing user/id: foo/1001

    #straggling user cleanup syslog output
    May  6 10:54:43 uone logger: /usr/local/bin/enforce-users-groups removing user/id: foo/1001

-> However, if you want to ensure a user is especially missing globally
-> Mark the user as 'ensure: absent'
-> Add the user to the meta 'absent' group

    groups:
      absent:
        members: [foo]

    users:
        foo:
        ensure: absent
        uid: 510
        gid: 500
        realname: Foo Bar
        ssh_keys: [ssh-rsa mykeyhash foobar@mac]

-> absent group users:
-> * are _always_ included in every batch of assignments
-> * should never have 'ensure: present'
-> * cannot be a member of any other group

Assigning groups/users:

-> one 'class admin' assignment per node must be done since we need state information on all assigned users
-> 'ops' and 'absent' groups are always included

        #create group and assign users
        node /myhost/ {
            class { 'admin': groups => ['mygroup'], }
        }

    or (including managed members of a system group):

        #this creates both groups, and all relevant users of both groups even with overlap
        node /myhost/ {
            class { 'admin': groups => ['mygroup', 'adm'], }
        }

        #creates three groups and all relevants users and permissions details
        node /myhost/ {
            class { 'admin': groups => ['mygroup',
                                        'adm',
                                        'foo'], }
        }

Assigning sudo permissions to a group:

    groups:
        adm:
        members: [foo, bar]
        privileges: [ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL]

    Creates: '/etc/sudoers.d/adm'

        # This file is managed by Puppet!
        %adm ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

Users can be given sudo permissions in the same way:

-> this is a limited use approach.  these permissions would apply across the entire env.

  foo:
    ensure: present
    privileges: [ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL]

Getting your /home/ stuff wherever you are:

-> if you define a dir for your username in '${module}/files/home' all contents are managed

    ├── files
    │   ├── home
    │   │   ├── foo
    │   │   │   └── .vimrc


#Notes:
#* Individual /home data is intended to live somewhere other than our Puppet repo once
   figure out where it should live permanently
#* Groups with no members get root by default
#* admin::user and admin::group are not dependent on yaml


Rarely used feature (USE WITH CARE AND CAUTION):

You can specify a name other than the group name in yaml to be the actual
on server posix name.  This means you can have the same group name across
different boxes with a unique description and grouping in yaml.  This can be
useful for sharing sensitive data across servers, or for backups, etc.

Such as:

groups:
  backup-files-foo:
    gid: 1000
    posix_name: stats
    members: [people who need backups on foo]

  backup-files-bar:
    gid: 1000
    posix_name: stats
    members: [people who need backups on bar]

Assignment:

  node /foo/ {
    class { 'admin': groups => ['backup-files-foo'] }
  }

  node /bar/ {
    class { 'admin': groups => ['backup-files-bar'] }
  }

If you try to apply two groupings with the same posix names on a single node you see:

    Duplicate definition: Admin::Group[$POSIX_NAME] is already defined
