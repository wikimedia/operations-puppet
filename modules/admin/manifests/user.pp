# A defined type for user account management.
#
# WARNING: this is designed to NOT play well with local modifications.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*name*]
#  The user of the user to be created.
#
# [*ensure*]
#  Add or remove the user account [ "present" | "absent"]
#
# [*uid*]
#  The UID to set for the new account. Must be globally unique.
#
# [*gid*]
#  Sets the primary group of this user.
#
#  NOTE: User created files default to this group
#
# [*groups*]
#  An array of additional groups to add the user to.
#
#  NOTE: user membership should almost exclusively be handled in the
#  external definition format (yaml)
#
#  WARNING: setting a group here means anywhere this user exists the
#           group _has_ to exist also.  More than likely they should be added
#           to the appropriate group in Admin::Groups
#
# [*comment*]
#  Typicaly the realname for the user.
#
# [*shell*]
#  The login shell.
#
# [*privileges*]
#  An array of sudo privileges to setup
#  Rarely should a user differ from an established group.
#
# [*ssh_keys*]
#  An array of strings containing the SSH public keys.
#
