* `Todo and Done`_: Todos and Logs
* Issues_: Known Issues
* Contribution_: Help improving

Install
-------
* Using Vundle_  (Recommended)

  Add this line to your vimrc::
 
    Bundle 'Rykka/riv.vim'


* Using downloaded zip/tar.gz file. 
  Just extract it to your ``.vim`` folder .


:NOTE: Make sure your .vim folder in option ``runtimepath`` 
       is before the $VIMRUNTIME, otherwise the syntax/indent files
       for rst files will use vim's built-in one.

       Default is before $VIMRUNTIME.

:NOTE: Make sure ``filetype plugin indent on`` and ``syntax on`` is in your vimrc

:NOTE: It's a developing version. 
       So things may change quickly.

       Keep up-to-date.

       You can get the latest version at https://github.com/Rykka/riv.vim 

* Related tools: 

  + python: docutils_ , required for converting to other format.
  + python: pygments_ for syntax highlighting in other format.
  + python: Sphinx_ for Sphinx users.
  + vim: Syntastic_  for syntax checking. docutils_ required.

    But if you are using Sphinx_'s tools set, you'd better not using it.
    Cause it could not recognize the sphinx's markups.
