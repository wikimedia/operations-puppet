====================================
Generating Latex-Suite documentation
====================================

You need:
- xsltproc
- Docbook XSL stylesheets (*)
- Docbook DTD (*)

(*) These files will be downloaded every time you create the documentation,
unless you install or download them.

On Fedora, you can run as root:

yum install libxslt docbook-style-xsl docbook-dtds

to install the required packages.
