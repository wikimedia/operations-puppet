Generating Latex-Suite documentation
====================================

In order to generate the html files and vim-help files from the XML source,
you will need to do follow the following steps. The steps are complex only
for a windows machine. On most (modern) linux machines, the various
utilities are already installed and all you need to do is some
soft-linking.

1. Download the Docbook XSL stylesheets from

        http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=21935
    
   I downloaded docbook-xsl-1.61.2.tar.gz.  Unpack this archive under the
   present directory. You should see something like::

        ./docbook-xsl-1.XX.X/

   Rename this to::

        ./docbook-xsl

   Alternatively, if you are on a modern unix system, the docbook-xsl
   stylesheets should already be installed on your system. Soft-linking
   will thus work more simply. On a typical Debian box, just do::
   
        ln -s  /usr/share/sgml/docbook/stylesheet/xsl/nwalsh docbook-xsl

   The docbook-xsl stylesheets can be installed via the docbook-xsl
   package on Debian. (Just use apt-get).

2. Download the Docbook DTD from

        http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.2/docbook-xml-4.2.zip
        
   Extract this into a subdirectory ``docbook-xml/`` under the present
   directory. You should see something like::

        ./docbook-xml/

   with a file ``docbookx.dtd`` located there.

   **CAUTION**: 
        The archive above does not create a top level directory but
        unzips directly into the present directory. Therefore, make sure to
        run the unzip by first creating ``./docbook-xml/``, copying the zip
        file there and then unzipping.

   Alternatively, if you are on a modern unix system, the docbook-xml DTD
   will already be installed. Softlinking will thus work. On a typical
   Debian box, you could do::

        ln -s /usr/share/sgml/docbook/dtd/xml/4.2 docbook-xml

   On debian, you need the docbook-xml package on Debian. (Just use
   apt-get).

3. Download saxon.jar from

        http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/documentation/saxon.jar

   This is the bare .jar file without any of the other things which saxon
   comes with.  Add the ``saxon.jar`` file to your ``$CLASSPATH`` setting.

   **NOTE:** 
        The ``$CLASSPATH`` setting should point to the ``saxon.jar`` file,
        not the directory where it resides.

   Again, on a unix system, you might not need to download this. For debian
   systems, the saxon.jar file resides in::

        /usr/share/java/saxon.jar

   You can point your ``$CLASSPATH`` to that file.

4. Download db2vim (created by me :)) via anonymous cvs::

        mkdir -p ~/bin/db2vim
        cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.vim-latex.sf.net:/cvsroot/vim-latex \
            co -d ~/bin/db2vim db2vim

   Add the ``~/bin/db2vim/`` directory thus created to your ``$PATH``
   setting.

5. Create a new directory ``latex-suite/`` under the present directory for
   the chunked html files to reside in. You should see something like::

        ./latex-suite/

6. Copy ``Makefile.in`` to ``Makefile`` or ``makefile`` and perform any
   necessary customizations. For example, if you are using Activestate
   python under windows, you will need to change the ls-txt: target as::

        python e:/srinath/testing/db2vim/db2vim latex-suite.xml > latex-suite.txt


Thats it! You are ready. Now you can do::

    make ls-chunk
    make ls-flat
    make ls-txt

to create the 3 formats.
