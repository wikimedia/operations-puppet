Wikimedia Puppet Modules
========================

Overview
--------

The Wikimedia Foundation operates some of the largest collaboratively
edited reference projects in the world, including Wikipedia. Our
infrastructure powers some of the most highly-trafficked sites on the
web, serving content in over a hundred languages to more than half
a billion people each month. We use Puppet to manage our server
configuration. This is our Puppet repository.

For an overview of how we use Puppet, and a review of the code
conventions and patterns that apply to this repository, see:
