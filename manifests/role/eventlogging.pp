# == Class: role::eventlogging
#
# This role configures an instance to act as the primary EventLogging
# log processor for the cluster. The setup is described in detail on
# <https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/EventLogging>. End-user
# documentation is available in the form of a guide, located at
# <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:EventLogging/Guide>.
#
# There exist two APIs for generating events: efLogServerSideEvent() in
# PHP and mw.eventLog.logEvent() in JavaScript. Events generated in PHP
# are sent by the app servers directly to vanadium on UDP port 8421.
# JavaScript-generated events are URL-encoded and sent to our servers by
# means of an HTTP/S request to bits, which a varnishncsa instance
# forwards to vanadium on port 8422. These event streams are parsed,
# validated, and multiplexed into an output stream that is published via
# ZeroMQ on TCP port 8600. Data sinks are implemented as subscribers
# that connect to this endpoint and read data into some storage medium.

    ## Data flow

    # Server-side events are generated by MediaWiki and sent to vanadium
    # on UDP port 8421, using wfErrorLog('...', 'udp://...'). vanadium
    # is specified as the destination in $wgEventLoggingFile, declared
    # in wmf-config/CommonSettings.php.

    # Client-side events are generated by JavaScript-triggered HTTP/S
    # requests to //bits.wikimedia.org/event.gif?<event payload>.
    # A varnishncsa instance on the bits caches greps for these requests
    # and forwards them to vanadium on UDP port 8422. The varnishncsa
    # configuration is specified in <manifests/role/cache.pp>.
