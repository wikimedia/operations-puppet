# == Class: role::gdash
#
# https://gdash.wikimedia.org/ is a static mirror of the site that was
# previously served at that URL -- a dashboard templating webapp for Graphite.
# At the time of writing (October 2015), we are in the process of migrating to
# Grafana (https://grafana.wikimedia.org), but gdash continues to receive
# traffic, so we preserved it here.
