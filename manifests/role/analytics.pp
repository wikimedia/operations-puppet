    # NOTE:  If you are filling an RT request for Hadoop access,
    # you will need to add the user to the list of accounts above,
    # as well as manually create the user's HDFS home directory.
    # Once the user's posix account is created on analytics1010
    # (the Hadoop NameNode), run these commands:
    #
    #   sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -mkdir /user/<username>
    #   sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -chown <username>:stats /user/<username>
    #

    # Users in the stats group will be able to read private data in HDFS.
