# == Class role::analytics::clients
# Includes common client classes for

    # as well as manually create the user's HDFS home directory.

    # (the Hadoop NameNode), run these commands:
    #
    #   sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -mkdir /user/<username>
    #   sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -chown <username>:stats /user/<username>
