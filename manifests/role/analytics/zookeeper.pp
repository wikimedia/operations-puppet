# role/analytics/zookeeper.pp
#
# Role classes for Analytics Zookeeper nodes.
# These role classes will configure Zookeeper properly in either
# the Analytics labs or Analytics production environments.
#
# Usage:
#
# If you only need Zookeeper client configs to talk to Zookeeper servers:
#   include role::analytics::zookeeper::client
#
# If you want to set up a Zookeeper server:
#   include role::analytics::zookeeper::server
#

# == Class role::analytics::zookeeper::config
# Bare config role class for client and server classes.
# You may include this class manually if you need to know use the
# $role::analytics::zookeeper::hosts or
# $role::analytics::zookeeper::hosts_array variables.
#
class role::analytics::zookeeper::config {

        # the labs wikitech console global variables.
